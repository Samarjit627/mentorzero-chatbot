YC Copilot Agent ‚Äî Vision & Goals
Vision & Goals:

I want to build a personal YC Knowledge Copilot Agent that can act as a continuous founder mentor for me.

Y Combinator has published hundreds of videos with timeless and highly practical advice on fundraising, product-market fit, growth, community building, company building, and more. However, this knowledge is fragmented across ~710+ YouTube videos, difficult to search deeply, and not personalized to my startup context.

My goal is to build an agent that:

‚úÖ Ingests and continuously updates YC video content
‚úÖ Allows me to ask specific founder questions in natural language
‚úÖ Provides answers grounded in actual YC content (citing source videos when possible)
‚úÖ Tailors the advice to my current project contexts and stage

Over time, I want this agent to become a personalized mentor that helps me think better, make faster decisions, and stay aligned with proven founder principles ‚Äî while being tuned to my real-world projects.

My Current Projects (Project Context for Agent)
1Ô∏è‚É£ Axis5 ‚Äî AI-Powered Manufacturing Copilot (Primary Project)
Axis5 is an AI-driven manufacturing copilot for engineers, designers, procurement teams, and early-stage startups.

Problem:
Today, designers and engineers create CAD files, but understanding how to manufacture those designs at scale is fragmented and painful. DFM (Design for Manufacturability) checks are siloed, material-process decisions are hard, and manufacturing cost estimation is often trial-and-error.

Vision:
Axis5 aims to build the Manufacturing Feedback OS ‚Äî an intelligent layer that sits after CAD creation and before manufacturing ‚Äî helping users answer:

How manufacturable is my part?

What risks exist in my design?

What material and process should I use?

How can I reduce cost or improve quality?

Which vendors are best suited for this part?

Key Features Being Built:

Tolerance Intelligence Engine

Assembly Impact Checker

Manufacturability Confidence Score (0‚Äì100)

Process-specific DFM logic (CNC, molding, sheet metal, 3D printing, casting, etc.)

Cost Optimizer and Tooling Estimator

Factory Context Layer and Manufacturing Signal Forecast Layer

Audience:

MSMEs, startups, R&D labs, large enterprise design & engineering teams.

Why YC Copilot Matters for Axis5:

I need YC advice on how to build a deep-tech SaaS startup.

How to pitch and position AI-first B2B tools.

How to create defensibility in an AI-heavy tool.

How to navigate product-market fit and early GTM for an engineering-focused product.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Purring Threads ‚Äî Cat-Themed Jewelry Brand (Side Project)
Purring Threads is a handcrafted embroidered jewelry and accessories brand based in Bangalore, India ‚Äî co-founded with my wife.

Background:
The brand started in 2023 and achieved:

20+ exhibitions (including Pili Taxi, Hundred Hands)

100+ SKUs

10K+ products sold

24K+ customers

Operations paused after August 2024 due to personal reasons (new baby). Now planning a strong comeback in 2025.

Relaunch Focus:

Launching a new ‚ÄúCat Brooch‚Äù collection inspired by our 5 rescued cats: Drackie, Piku, Noori, Meenu, Coco.

Building an influencer and content-first marketing strategy (Instagram + YouTube).

Adding workshop-based revenue stream (DIY kits + pre-recorded content).

Targeting the growing community of cat lovers + pet parents + jewelry enthusiasts.

Why YC Copilot Matters for Purring Threads:

I want YC advice on building niche consumer brands.

How to create early community and repeat customers.

How to balance content + commerce.

How to think about scaling craft-based businesses without losing authenticity.

Final Notes
I am a multi-project founder.

I move between deep-tech B2B SaaS (Axis5) and niche D2C brand (Purring Threads).

The agent should always be aware of this context and tune answers accordingly.

Example tuning:

For Axis5 questions ‚Üí give advice suitable for B2B SaaS, AI-first products, deep-tech selling.

For Purring Threads questions ‚Üí give advice suitable for D2C, community-first brands, content-driven marketing.

Summary
üëâ The YC Copilot Agent is intended to become my personal thinking partner, infused with the best of YC‚Äôs startup wisdom ‚Äî but always aware of my projects and current goals.
