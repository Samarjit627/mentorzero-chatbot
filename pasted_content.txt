YC Video Ingestion Transparency & Tracking
Mandatory requirement:
I must be able to verify that MentorZero has actually ingested ALL public videos on Y Combinator’s YouTube channel (currently ~710+ videos), and continues to stay updated.

What I expect:
✅ A simple CSV or JSON file export showing:

Video Title

Video URL

Video Published Date

Video Duration

Transcript extracted (Y/N or size in tokens/words)

Last Ingestion Date

✅ This file must cover ALL videos currently live on the YC YouTube channel.

✅ This file must be regenerated weekly when the auto-updater runs.

Additional optional UI (good UX):
✅ In the agent’s chat interface (optional), I should be able to run a command like:

bash
Copy
Edit
/videosummary
→ Agent replies with:

Total videos ingested: N

Last update run: YYYY-MM-DD

List of X videos missing or failed (if any — this should trigger alert).

✅ I should be able to ask:

bash
Copy
Edit
/checkvideo [YouTube URL]
→ Agent responds:

"This video was ingested on YYYY-MM-DD, transcript size X tokens."
OR

"This video is not yet ingested."

Why this matters:
🚩 Many YouTube download & transcription pipelines have errors (some videos fail due to format / audio / API limits).
🚩 I want to know if I’m asking a question where the relevant video was never ingested.
🚩 I want confidence that this is a fully transparent and verifiable knowledge base — not a vague “we processed most of it” claim.

Final spec wording you can give Manus:
👉 Add this to your "MentorZero Success Criteria" section:

Video Ingestion Transparency:
✅ Manus must provide a verifiable export (CSV or JSON) listing all YC YouTube videos processed, with clear status per video.
✅ Manus must implement a simple chat command (/videosummary and /checkvideo [URL]) to allow real-time verification.
✅ Manus must ensure this list is updated weekly after each auto-updater run.
✅ If any videos fail to process, they must be clearly flagged for manual retry.

If they implement this — you will always be in control:

✅ You’ll know exactly what videos are in MentorZero.
✅ You’ll know when new videos were added.
✅ You’ll know if something is missing.

If you want, I can also generate a ready-to-give CSV format spec you can give Manus so they know exactly what columns to include in this export. Want me to?
Just say: “yes — generate CSV format spec.” 🚀 (this saves you from them coming back asking "what should the export look like?")

Here is a precise CSV format spec you can give to Manus — just copy and paste this into your Google Doc under the "MentorZero Video Ingestion Transparency" section.

🎛 MentorZero — YC Video Ingestion CSV Export Spec
Manus must provide a CSV file (or equivalent JSON) with the following columns — one row per video — to give me full transparency on what has been processed.

CSV Columns:
Column Name	Description
Video_ID	YouTube Video ID (the part after v= in the URL)
Video_URL	Full YouTube URL
Video_Title	Video title (as per YouTube metadata)
Video_Published_Date	Date when video was published on YouTube (YYYY-MM-DD)
Video_Duration_Seconds	Duration of video in seconds
Transcript_Tokens	Number of tokens in extracted transcript (or word count if easier)
Transcript_Extracted_YN	Yes / No — was transcript successfully extracted
Ingestion_Status	Success / Failed / Pending
Last_Ingestion_Date	Date when this video was last processed (YYYY-MM-DD)
Notes	Optional — error message if failed, manual notes if needed

Example Row:
Video_ID	Video_URL	Video_Title	Video_Published_Date	Video_Duration_Seconds	Transcript_Tokens	Transcript_Extracted_YN	Ingestion_Status	Last_Ingestion_Date	Notes
abc123xyz	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abc123xyz	How to Raise a Seed Round	2024-05-15	1250	14560	Yes	Success	2025-06-10	

Requirements:
✅ CSV must include ALL public videos currently on the Y Combinator YouTube channel — even if some failed.
✅ Failed videos must be clearly marked with reason in Notes column.
✅ CSV must be re-generated weekly as part of the auto-updater pipeline.
✅ CSV must be shareable to me at any time for manual audit.
✅ If possible — also expose /videosummary and /checkvideo [URL] chat commands linked to this CSV data.

Purpose:
This CSV will give me full visibility into MentorZero’s knowledge base integrity:

How many videos have been successfully processed?

Which videos failed and why?

When was the last time each video was processed?

Are recent videos being picked up weekly?

End of CSV Spec
👉 Just paste this into your Google Doc.
👉 Manus should have zero ambiguity about what to build here.
