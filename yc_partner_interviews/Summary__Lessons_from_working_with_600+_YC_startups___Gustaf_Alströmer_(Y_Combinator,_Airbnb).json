He’s also a fellow Airbnb alumnus along with Lenny and started the original Airbnb growth team.\nIf I drill down what makes companies fail, it’s quite simple. It’s just like they don’t talk to users, which means they don’t find product-market fit. And if they don’t find product-market fit, nothing else really matters. What mistakes  people make is all about that. It’s all about talking to customers and learning that you’re building something that’s actually useful. YC Slack headline is “Make things people want,” and it’s still true and it’s always going to be true.\nIf I drill down what makes companies fail, it’s quite simple.

Folks were diverse, including former founders and people outside the technology industry, which contributed to better decision-making and a YC-like mindset.\nAirbnb felt like a group of friends with a special bond working on a project rather than a job.

The second thing was to understand their true motivations and make sure they mapped to the company’s core values. Airbnb did this through “culture interviews.”\nThe most important thing Airbnb looked for in early hires is how excited they were to be there.

Motivation doesn’t necessarily determine success, and we have seen motivations change over time, e.g. just running the company and enjoying the process of building something big, even if the idea is not grand or shiny.\nMotivations can be diverse: solving technical problems, proving oneself, having a grand mission, or simply wanting to be successful.

Did you hit the goals? If not, what came in the way of hitting the goals?”\nAddresses the loneliness of the founders by allowing them to lean on others who share similar problems and anxieties.\nAddresses the loneliness of the founders by allowing them to lean on others who share similar problems and anxieties.\nCreates accountability by having founders share their goals and progress every two weeks.\nCreates accountability by having founders share their goals and progress every two weeks.\nFounders in coworking spaces should schedule time to talk, because by default they end up working by themselves with headphones on and no time for interaction. YC’s best experiences were in person, with everyone paying attention to each other without distractions.\nCommon reasons startups fail ▶️\nFailing to find product-market fit because they don’t talk to customers:\nFailing to find product-market fit because they don’t talk to customers:\nOften because they think software is the solution to everything, or because they’re afraid of rejection. Ninety percent of customers are not early adopters, so they’re not incentivized to take risks and try something new, and you need to reach out to 10 customers to be able to find that one.\nExternal validation (e.g. investments, praise) is often confused with product-market fit, leading to neglect of customer input. One of the most important moments in Airbnb history was Paul Graham asking the founders of Airbnb, “Where are your customers?,” to which they said, “Oh, they’re in New York,” and Graham responded, “So why are you talking to me and not in New York right now talking to them?”\n2.  Lacking technical knowledge: Startups need technical founders who can build the first prototype.\nKey advice: Talk to customers, learn what they want, and build products that address their needs.\nThe importance of solving pain points and why you should watch users ▶️\nFounders fear that users will try their product and hate it, but the most common thing that happens is the user is indifferent. So if you make improvements and come back after a while, they’ll always give you a second chance. Airbnb started with air mattresses and iterated from there, and Brian Chesky continues to do that today .\nFounders fear that users will try their product and hate it, but the most common thing that happens is the user is indifferent.

That will give you a much better sense of their pain points.\nDon’t ask users if something is working—watch them do it.

Engineering is really hard and valuable.\nHaving an idea and trying to find technical co-founder to build it is like having an idea for a song and looking for a musician to make it.

Many successful startup founders also learn how to code.\nStart by asking the best technical people you know if they’re interested in starting a company with you, or ask for introductions to others.

One good indicator, though, is if every Office Hours there are new things to talk about (progress on a weekly timescale).\nAre successful founders more focused on...?\nSpeed vs. quality: It’s a false choice. If you know what the customer wants, you’ll come up with something that’s high-quality and move fast. Confidence vs. humility: Successful founders need both to motivate and attract employees, investors, and customers. Execution and tactics vs. strategy: Execution is most important pre-product-market fit, while strategy comes into play afterward, where multiple tasks can be tackled simultaneously. Autocratic vs. collaboration-driven: In early-stage startups with small teams, autocratic decision-making is not feasible. Be willing to adhere to the agreed-upon process. Cares more about product vs. distribution: Early-stage founders should care more about product (from the user’s perspective, not the founder’s), but the growth mindset is very useful when something is working.\nSpeed vs. quality: It’s a false choice.

It’s not just about doing good for the world; it has strong economic incentives as well, Tesla being a good example.\nGustaf and David Rusenko (CEO of Weebly) wrote a request for startups in climate tech with a detailed list of ideas and areas of opportunity, and have invested in over 130 companies.

What’s needed are core PM and engineering skills, not necessarily deep scientific knowledge or domain expertise.\nSoftware founders are realizing their skills are relevant in addressing climate change.

Carbon accounting and recommendation systems help companies track and reduce emissions like Unravel Carbon (Singapore), Carbon Chain (U.K.), and Sinai (Bay Area). Enode is building a software platform for EV chargers and home energy systems, similar to Plaid. Statiq is the Airbnb for EV charging in India, creating a bottom-up EV charging system and platform. Aviation startups include Heart Aerospace and Right Electric , which focus on battery electric planes for commercial aviation.\nIn shipping, Seabound focuses on carbon capture and removal for ships, while Fleetzero builds electric ships.

In the past 12 months: 1. Political change: In the U.S., the Inflation Reduction Act supports green energy and onshoring supply chains for the green economy. 2. Corporations as customers: Fortune 100 companies now invest in decarbonization solutions due to pressure from shareholders, governments, and public promises.\nClimate tech is a profitable market, with battery prices and solar costs decreasing and wind power increasing.

The 100% Solution , by Solomon Goldstein-Rose for climate change. Also, Without a Doubt , by Surbhi Sarna.\n2. Favorite movie/show? Emily in Paris and Everything Everywhere All at Once .\n3. Favorite interview question with YC? “What have you done since you applied to YC for your product?”\n4. Most out-there wild startups you have funded? Heart Aerospace .\n5. What’s a pro tip for applying to YC? Watch YouTube videos about hacking the application from other founders and reach out to them.\n6. What’s one pro tip for visiting Sweden? Go during summer, explore the wild nature, and be prepared for a different social vibe compared to the U.S.\n\nThis is a human edited summary of the podcast episode with Gustaf, by Gaurav Chandrashekar ( @cggaurav , productscale.xyz ).
