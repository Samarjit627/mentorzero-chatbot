Plus, he shares how AI startups are making millions with just 5 people while big tech sleeps. The game has changed completely\nHost: Shane Parrish ( @ShaneAParrish )\n00:02:39 – The Success of Y Combinator\nY combinator started because of Paul Graham and Jessica Livingston\nPaul Graham was just trying to help people and follow his own interests\nHe knew how to make products and software that people could use\nHe sold his company ViaWeb (like an early Shopify)\nPaul was one of the first people to hook up a web request to a program in Unix\nHe’s an auto-dedact, great engineer, and polymath\n“I think Paul Graham and his essays became a schelling point for people who wanted to do the thing that he wanted to do.” David Senra ( @FoundersPodcast ) guides us through the hardest-hitting quotes from some of Paul Graham’s Essays\nDavid Senra ( @FoundersPodcast ) guides us through the hardest-hitting quotes from some of Paul Graham’s Essays\n00:04:25 – The Y Combinator Program\nThe program started in 2005 with just a dozen people in the first program\nSam Altman went through that first program\nIt drew people who had ideas that spoke to them\nThe idea that someone could create software that a billion people could use\nYC is basically software events and media (forms of extreme leverage)\nPeople who wanted to start startups found Paul’s essays, then found YC\nEarly successes: Steve Huffman (Reddit), then Dropbox, Airbnb, Coinbase, DoorDash\nAirbnb now houses more people than the biggest hotel chains\n“We attract people who want to create those things and then we give them money. And then more importantly, I think the know-how is we give it away for free.”\n00:08:25 – The Application Process\nThey get about 70-80,000 applications per year\nThey use software to help filter applications\nHave 13 general partners who read applications\nThey watch the one-minute video you post\nMost important thing is trying the products people build\nThey consider resume, careers, and education but it’s not the main thing\nWhat matters most is what you’ve built and what you can build\nPartners read about 1000-1500 applications per cycle\n00:09:58 – The Interview Process\nThe last filter is a 10-minute interview\nThey look for crisp communication\nFirst question: “what is it” and “why are you working on it”\nBetter answers show you’ve spent time working on it and reached the edge of knowledge\nBest interviews teach you about an entire market in 10 minutes\nLike traveling the “idea maze” with the people you’re talking to\nLooking for signal there’s a real problem to be solved\nGreat startups solve real problems people will pay for with durable moats\nOne of the things he learned from Paul was this: if, in 10 minutes, you can’t actually understand what’s going on, it means the person on the other end doesn’t really understand it either\n00:16:16 – The Challenge of Early Stage Investment\n5% of Y Combinator companies become billion dollar companies\nAbout 2.5% become decacorns (worth $10B+)\nThey have the highest batting average of any VC firm besides maybe Sequoia\nMost VCs do hundreds of hours of work per company\nYC is earlier than everyone else – giving half a million when it’s just an idea\nYC gives $500k now (started with $20k)\nThe unicorn rate has gone up over time (3.5-4% before, now 5.5%)\nSome batches from 2017-2018 are pushing 8-10%\nAbout 50% of companies end up raising a Series A\nA quarter of those who raise Series A do it in year 5 or later\nThey fund very young founders who need time to mature\n“We’re funding people who are so young that sometimes they’ve never shipped software before.”\n00:22:53 – The Role of San Francisco in Innovation\nTeams that come to San Francisco and stay double their chance of becoming a unicorn\nRent should be lower in San Francisco\nNeed to increase supply of housing radically\nThere were no new housing starts in all of San Francisco proper for the last year\nSF is the microcosm where people build the future\nIt’s the “siren song” for 150 IQ people who are ambitious and techno-optimistic\nSociety isn’t serving itself well if it gets in the way of smart people solving problems\n“If it’s one thing that you could do, it’s be around people and be in the place where making something brand new is in the water.”\n00:28:32 – The Ideal Founder\nThey don’t want people just focused on raising money or high-status investors\nSome founders become “scenesters” trying to get followers on Twitter\nYC tries to redirect them back to product market fit actually building and iterating\nGetting customers and long-term retention are the fundamentals\nFounders can kill their startups by taking their eye off the ball\nSome do things like angel investing or becoming scouts when they should be focused\nBetter to find people who have a problem they want to solve using technology\nMost successful companies start with founders who never meant to start a company\nLike Steve Jobs and Wozniak who just wanted to make a computer for themselves\n00:36:27 – The Importance of Earnestness\nThe #1 characteristic is earnestness – incredibly sincere\nWhat you see is what you get – not trying to be something else\nAuthentic but also humble\nHe sees this in Brian Armstrong at Coinbase (unusual for crypto founders)\nBrian is the opposite of Sam Bankman-Fried- he “speed ran” the money/power/fame game and stole funds\nBrian read the Satoshi Nakamoto white paper and worked backward from that future\nHis motivation came from his own experience with financial systems at Airbnb\nHe saw how remittance is a scam with too many fees\n00:42:17 – The Changing Landscape of AI Companies\nBlitz scaling for AI might not be a thing\nBlitz scaling uses capital as a weapon and happens when interest rates are descending\nThis was true for marketplace startups like Uber, Lyft, DoorDash\nNow he’s seeing incredible revenue growth with way fewer people\nCompanies going from zero to $6M in revenue in 6 months\nCompanies going from zero to $12M a year in 12 months with under a dozen people\nWill see companies that get to $500M a year in revenue with maybe 10-15 people\nThis is the silver lining to a decade of big tech centralized power\nHope is for thousands of companies each making hundreds of millions to billions\n00:45:26 – The Impact of Cloud Computing\nCloud computing enabled YC to exist in 2005\nIn 1999-2000, projects cost millions because you had to pay for Oracle licenses\nHad to pay hundreds of thousands to rack real servers\nJeff Bezos launched AWS at a YC startup school at Stanford in 2008\nCloud opened it up so startups didn’t need to raise $5-10M just for servers\nIn the past, Stanford/Harvard MBAs would be CEOs and they’d get a “hacker in a cage” as CTO\nNow the CEO of majority of YC companies are technical\n“The cost of even starting a company was just huge.”\n00:50:11 – Dysfunction with Silicon Valley\nBig companies have too many people\nThey lack founder mode – where the founder has a hand in all parts of the company\nClassic management advice is to hire the best people and give them rope\nBut if the founder/CEO doesn’t exercise agency, it becomes a political game\nFiefdoms fight with each other\nThe leader isn’t there and everyone is disempowered\nPeople work against each other or don’t work at all\nThis dysfunction exists in every Silicon Valley company\nPeople are becoming aware that’s not the way to run a company\n00:52:24 – Forecast for the Tech Market\nThe world is full of problems that aren’t being solved\nPeople at big companies are retired in place earning insane salaries\nThey build software that doesn’t change or improve\nYou can find obvious bugs in products from Google, Apple, Facebook\nTeams are being paid millions to make some of the worst software\nBugs never get fixed because people don’t care and no one’s paying attention\nThis is the result of treating people like hoarded resources\nShould be focusing on solving real problems instead\n00:54:40 – The Regulation of AI\nBiden’s EO had language about regulating based on mathematical operations\nFelt like early versions of regulatory capture\nWanted to restrict open source and limit the number of players\nNow there are 5-6 labs competing in a fair market\nAny startup can pick and choose from these models\nNo monopoly danger or crazy pricing power by one entity\nIt’s a much fairer playing field today\nA new Google-style oligopoly is emerging around who provides AI models\nMultiple providers is best for consumers and citizens – you’ll have choice\n00:55:56 – The Need for Agency in Education\nThe first wave of AI safety people basically watched Terminator 2\nThey worry about AI becoming self-aware and taking agency\nCurrent systems are just Matrix math with no agency yet – “incredibly smart toasters”\nThis means there’s still a clear role for humans\nAgency is important – what we should teach our kids\nOur school system is designed to take agency away from children. We should find ways to give children as much agency as possible\nHe’s pro-screens, Minecraft, Roblox – giving children playgrounds for agency\nSynthesis tutor : designed to increase rather than decrease agency\nEl Salvador replaced K-5 math with Synthesis tutor with amazing results\n01:01:40 – AI in Biotech and Manufacturing\nLevel 4 AGI as defined by OpenAI is “innovators”\nStartups are applying the latest reasoning models to scientific/engineering use cases\nA cancer vaccine company Helix (YC company) is hooking up models to wet lab tests\nApplying $2 of energy into models could lead to breakthroughs in biological sciences\nA YC company camfer is applying AI to airfoil design\nThey won a YC-01 hackathon with OpenAI\nAI can increase lift ratio by thinking about airfoil design with certain constraints\nThese are optimistic examples of how AI can increase standard of living…\n01:07:24 – The Issue of Data Access and The Legal Aspects of AI Outputs\nData access for LLMs is a gray area\nSome LLMs buy access or steal access to data\nAt some point it feels like fair use\nFor generated outputs like the airfoil design, it’s unclear if it’s patentable\nGenerated images are not copyrightable\nPeople will take AI outputs and submit patents without disclosing AI use\nIdea: create a startup that reads all patent filings and generates the next logical step\n01:13:34 – The Role of Meta in AI Development\nMeta/Facebook is doing God’s work by spending over $50B and releasing everything open source\nThey put AI in everyone’s faces on Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp\nBut they don’t think about the basic product integration\nThey’re sprinkling it in as a checkbox rather than being unified about it\nThe way we interface with computers is going to totally change\nWhat Anthropic is doing with Claude is important\nEvery major lab will need something similar\nWe’re seeing parent models and child models with distillation happening\nA 1.5 billion parameter model got 84% on the AI-ME math test\nThat’s small enough to fit on anyone’s phone\nWe’re learning day by day that intelligent models will be on desktops and phones\n01:28:07 – The Potential of AI in Decision Making\nAI calling plays in football instead of humans? An AI with o1 Pro could be ahead of human play-callers\nWould know who’s on field, who’s moving slower than normal\nCould see correlations from historical data humans would never pick up\nMight see a crazy speed up because of human effects\nOrganizations make decisions for reasons beyond what they claim\nCorporations do things not for stated reasons but because of power dynamics\nThis is why politics inside companies works against the collective\nAI could be a mayor before becoming a CEO\nBut would rather have a real human being, like with airplane pilots\nEven if autopilot is used 90% of the time, you always need a human in the loop\n01:40:33 – Defining AGI\nIn many domains, it feels like AGI is already here\nAI can have conversations about wine pairings indistinguishable from humans\nAbout 5-10% of things are hitting the Turing test now\nThis year it might go from 10% to 30%\nThe year after it might double again\nThe next few years are actually the golden age of building AI\nHe’s super optimistic about the next five years\nWe’ll discover things, make progress, and impact humanity\n01:42:03 – The Use of AI and Prompting\nJake Heller of Casetext was “the first man on the moon” – first to successfully commercialize GPT-4\nHe got access to GPT-3.5 and started playing with it, and realized it could write a legal argument… but GPT-3.5 hallucinated too much\nWhen GPT-4 came out, it was this transformational leap\nThey built CoCounsel on it\nHe was the first person to successfully productize GPT-4 into a real thing that you can use and trust. And the trick was actually prompting\nIf it hallucinated, it was because you were asking it to do too much in one prompt\nYou had to break the task into a bunch of little prompts\nThey figured out what worked: give it a role, give it instructions, tell it what format the answer should be in, give it the jurisdiction, give it the facts and the issue, and tell it what not to rely on\nDon’t ask it to do too much, and you’ll get deterministic output\nThey analyzed what real lawyers do and replicated it step by step: they use colored flags, highlighters, and they look for a certain type of argument\n01:47:09 – AI Model Reasoning\nHe uses AI with his kids to make stories\no1-pro is extra good now\nDeepSeek-R1 is one of the first open source versions of reasoning models\nWhat Jake Heller did by breaking into chain of thoughts maps to how reasoning models work\nReasoning models do these steps in the background for o1 and o3\nIn Chat GPT you see a summary of the steps\nIn open source models like DeepSeek-R1, you can see pages of the model talking to itself\nIt’s asking “does this make sense?” and breaking things down into steps\nWhat was manual before is now happening automatically in reasoning models\nThat’s what happens with test time compute – spending more time thinking before output\n01:49:48 – The Competitive Advantage in AI\nThe model itself is not the moat – the evals are the moat\nA good prompt engineer will have better golden evals\nBut Sam Altman tells startups to count on models getting better\nAn advantage might last this year but not past it\nEven with GPT-4/03, other advantages still apply\nBuilding a good user experience is critical\nCreating something that professionals recognize as made for them\n“The second best software in the world for everything is using ChatGPT, because you can basically copy and paste almost any workflow or any data.”\nThe first best is a great UI made by good designers and engineers\nYou still have to build good software, sell, retain customers\nBut now you might only need 6 people instead of 1000\n01:52:42 – Investing in Big Tech Companies\nIf investing 100% of net worth in 3 companies: 50% in NVIDIA 30% in Microsoft 20% in Meta\n50% in NVIDIA\n30% in Microsoft\n20% in Meta\nNVIDIA has an outright advantage now\n“I think that the demand for building the infrastructure for intelligence in society is going to be absolutely massive. And maybe on the order of the Manhattan Project, and we just haven’t really thought about it enough.”\nLevel 4 innovators could be “the meta project” – the Manhattan Project of creating more Manhattan Projects\nEnergy is the bigger problem – the limit will be climate crisis and available energy\nIf we can provide unlimited clean energy, that changes everything\nEven with universal basic robotics, energy access is the defining question\n01:55:47 – The Role of Microsoft and Meta in AI\nMicrosoft has deep access to OpenAI\nA large percentage of Microsoft’s market cap is predicated on Sam Altman and OpenAI’s success\nMeta is the dark horse because they’re amassing talent and have crazy distribution\nNever count Zuckerberg out\nZuck is always thinking about the next version of computing\nHe might have put too much money into AR prematurely\nAI for a fraction of what he put into AR is likely to push forward all of humanity\nWill accelerate technological progress in a profound way\n01:57:00 – Learning from MrBeast: YouTube Channel Optimization\nHe met with MrBeast who was very direct: “your titles suck and your thumbnails are even worse”\nMrBeast understands the YouTube algorithm completely\nFor titles – unfortunately it’s clickbait\nTrying to make smart content is tricky because you want clicks from smart people\nThey title episodes differently on YouTube than on audio feed\nFor thumbnails – a person looking into camera helps a lot\nNeed something recognizable when someone sees it\nShould have a distinct thumbnail style\nIf posting regularly, it’s important to have consistent recognizable style\nYouTube is about discovery – you get an audience but don’t keep it\nIf you’re regular and shameless about asking for subs, it helps\nSubs do very little – liking helps more, but watch time helps most\nThe extreme hack is asking for like, subscribe, and hitting the bell icon\n02:05:58 – The Perception of Founders\nHe learned from Paul Graham to be plain spoken and aware of artifice/bullshit\nIt’s easy to care too much about followers and vanity metrics\nFocus on signal-to-noise ratio\nGreat ideas aren’t thinking out loud but figuring out complex concepts and saying them in few words\nPaul spends days or weeks on essays, iterating and getting feedback\nWriting is thinking\nAt YC they help founders with their two-sentence pitch\nIt’s like a mantra or special incantation – you believe something nobody else does\nYou need to breathe that belief into others in as few words as possible\nPeople do complex things but need to explain what they do in one sentence\n02:08:23 – The Reality of Startup Success Rates\nThe median YC startup still fails\nYC might be the most successful institution of its kind\nBut the failure rate is absolutely insane\nA very small percentage create companies worth $50-100B\nThe remarkable thing isn’t that the success rate is low\nIt’s remarkable that it happens at all\n02:09:34 – The Impact of OpenAI\nSam Altman probably brought forward the future by 5-10 years\nSome critics point out that the transformer was made by other teams\nThose researchers did incredible things\nBut Sam and team believed something nobody else believed and brought resources to bear\n02:11:46 – The Golden Age of Building\nWe’re in the first pitch of the first inning of what’s about to happen\nIt’s going to be a great time for humanity and technology\nThe people in the trenches doing the work aren’t attacking their competition\nWe’re in the golden age of building\n“I’m so excited to be alive right now. So lucky, so blessed to be a witness to this. And I think we’re going to make so much progress on so many things.”"
