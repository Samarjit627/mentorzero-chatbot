Plus, he shares how AI startups are making millions with just 5 people while big tech sleeps. The game has changed completely\nHost: Shane Parrish ( @ShaneAParrish )\n00:02:39 – The Success of Y Combinator\nY combinator started because of Paul Graham and Jessica Livingston\nPaul Graham was just trying to help people and follow his own interests\nHe knew how to make products and software that people could use\nHe sold his company ViaWeb (like an early Shopify)\nPaul was one of the first people to hook up a web request to a program in Unix\nHe’s an auto-dedact, great engineer, and polymath\n“I think Paul Graham and his essays became a schelling point for people who wanted to do the thing that he wanted to do.” David Senra ( @FoundersPodcast ) guides us through the hardest-hitting quotes from some of Paul Graham’s Essays\nDavid Senra ( @FoundersPodcast ) guides us through the hardest-hitting quotes from some of Paul Graham’s Essays\n00:04:25 – The Y Combinator Program\nThe program started in 2005 with just a dozen people in the first program\nSam Altman went through that first program\nIt drew people who had ideas that spoke to them\nThe idea that someone could create software that a billion people could use\nYC is basically software events and media (forms of extreme leverage)\nPeople who wanted to start startups found Paul’s essays, then found YC\nEarly successes: Steve Huffman (Reddit), then Dropbox, Airbnb, Coinbase, DoorDash\nAirbnb now houses more people than the biggest hotel chains\n“We attract people who want to create those things and then we give them money. And then more importantly, I think the know-how is we give it away for free.”\n00:08:25 – The Application Process\nThey get about 70-80,000 applications per year\nThey use software to help filter applications\nHave 13 general partners who read applications\nThey watch the one-minute video you post\nMost important thing is trying the products people build\nThey consider resume, careers, and education but it’s not the main thing\nWhat matters most is what you’ve built and what you can build\nPartners read about 1000-1500 applications per cycle\n00:09:58 – The Interview Process\nThe last filter is a 10-minute interview\nThey look for crisp communication\nFirst question: “what is it” and “why are you working on it”\nBetter answers show you’ve spent time working on it and reached the edge of knowledge\nBest interviews teach you about an entire market in 10 minutes\nLike traveling the “idea maze” with the people you’re talking to\nLooking for signal there’s a real problem to be solved\nGreat startups solve real problems people will pay for with durable moats\nOne of the things he learned from Paul was this: if, in 10 minutes, you can’t actually understand what’s going on, it means the person on the other end doesn’t really understand it either\n00:16:16 – The Challenge of Early Stage Investment\n5% of Y Combinator companies become billion dollar companies\nAbout 2.5% become decacorns (worth $10B+)\nThey have the highest batting average of any VC firm besides maybe Sequoia\nMost VCs do hundreds of hours of work per company\nYC is earlier than everyone else – giving half a million when it’s just an idea\nYC gives $500k now (started with $20k)\nThe unicorn rate has gone up over time (3.5-4% before, now 5.5%)\nSome batches from 2017-2018 are pushing 8-10%\nAbout 50% of companies end up raising a Series A\nA quarter of those who raise Series A do it in year 5 or later\nThey fund very young founders who need time to mature\n“We’re funding people who are so young that sometimes they’ve never shipped software before.”\n00:22:53 – The Role of San Francisco in Innovation\nTeams that come to San Francisco and stay double their chance of becoming a unicorn\nRent should be lower in San Francisco\nNeed to increase supply of housing radically\nThere were no new housing starts in all of San Francisco proper for the last year\nSF is the microcosm where people build the future\nIt’s the “siren song” for 150 IQ people who are ambitious and techno-optimistic\nSociety isn’t serving itself well if it gets in the way of smart people solving problems\n“If it’s one thing that you could do, it’s be around people and be in the place where making something brand new is in the water.”\n00:28:32 – The Ideal Founder\nThey don’t want people just focused on raising money or high-status investors\nSome founders become “scenesters” trying to get followers on Twitter\nYC tries to redirect them back to product market fit actually building and iterating\nGetting customers and long-term retention are the fundamentals\nFounders can kill their startups by taking their eye off the ball\nSome do things like angel investing or becoming scouts when they should be focused\nBetter to find people who have a problem they want to solve using technology\nMost successful companies start with founders who never meant to start a company\nLike Steve Jobs and Wozniak who just wanted to make a computer for themselves\n00:36:27 – The Importance of Earnestness\nThe #1 characteristic is earnestness – incredibly sincere\nWhat you see is what you get – not trying to be something else\nAuthentic but also humble\nHe sees this in Brian Armstrong at Coinbase (unusual for crypto founders)\nBrian is the opposite of Sam Bankman-Fried- he “speed ran” the money/power/fame game and stole funds\nBrian read the Satoshi Nakamoto white paper and worked backward from that future\nHis motivation came from his own experience with financial systems at Airbnb\nHe saw how remittance is a scam with too many fees\n00:42:17 – The Changing Landscape of AI Companies\nBlitz scaling for AI might not be a thing\nBlitz scaling uses capital as a weapon and happens when interest rates are descending\nThis was true for marketplace startups like Uber, Lyft, DoorDash\nNow he’s seeing incredible revenue growth with way fewer people\nCompanies going from zero to $6M in revenue in 6 months\nCompanies going from zero to $12M a year in 12 months with under a dozen people\nWill see companies that get to $500M a year in revenue with maybe 10-15 people\nThis is the silver lining to a decade of big tech centralized power\nHope is for thousands of companies each making hundreds of millions to billions\n00:45:26 – The Impact of Cloud Computing\nCloud computing enabled YC to exist in 2005\nIn 1999-2000, projects cost millions because you had to pay for Oracle licenses\nHad to pay hundreds of thousands to rack real servers\nJeff Bezos launched AWS at a YC startup school at Stanford in 2008\nCloud opened it up so startups didn’t need to raise $5-10M just for servers\nIn the past, Stanford/Harvard MBAs would be CEOs and they’d get a “hacker in a cage” as CTO\nNow the CEO of majority of YC companies are technical\n“The cost of even starting a company was just huge.”\n00:50:11 – Dysfunction with Silicon Valley\nBig companies have too many people\nThey lack founder mode – where the founder has a hand in all parts of the company\nClassic management advice is to hire the best people and give them rope\nBut if the founder/CEO doesn’t exercise agency, it becomes a political game\nFiefdoms fight with each other\nThe leader isn’t there and everyone is disempowered\nPeople work against each other or don’t work at all\nThis dysfunction exists in every Silicon Valley company\nPeople are becoming aware that’s not the way to run a company\n00:52:24 – Forecast for the Tech Market\nThe world is full of problems that aren’t being solved\nPeople at big companies are retired in place earning insane salaries\nThey build software that doesn’t change or improve\nYou can find obvious bugs in products from Google, Apple, Facebook\nTeams are being paid millions to make some of the worst software\nBugs never get fixed because people don’t care and no one’s paying attention\nThis is the result of treating people like hoarded resources\nShould be focusing on solving real problems instead\n00:54:40 – The Regulation of AI\nBiden’s EO had language about regulating based on mathematical operations\nFelt like early versions of regulatory capture\nWanted to restrict open source and limit the number of players\nNow there are 5-6 labs competing in a fair market\nAny startup can pick and choose from these models\nNo monopoly danger or crazy pricing power by one entity\nIt’s a much fairer playing field today\nA new Google-style oligopoly is emerging around who provides AI models\nMultiple providers is best for consumers and citizens – you’ll have choice\n00:55:56 – The Need for Agency in Education\nThe first wave of AI safety people basically watched Terminator 2\nThey worry about AI becoming self-aware and taking agency\nCurrent systems are just Matrix math with no agency yet – “incredibly smart toasters”\nThis means there’s still a clear role for humans\nAgency is important – what we should teach our kids\nOur school system is designed to take agency away from children. We should find ways to give children as much agency as possible\nHe’s pro-screens, Minecraft, Roblox – giving children playgrounds for agency\nSynthesis tutor : designed to increase rather than decrease agency\nEl Salvador replaced K-5 math with Synthesis tutor with amazing results\n01:01:40 – AI in Biotech and Manufacturing\nLevel 4 AGI as defined by OpenAI is “innovators”\nStartups are applying the latest reasoning models to scientific/engineering use cases\nA cancer vaccine company Helix (YC company) is hooking up models to wet lab tests\nApplying $2 of energy into models could lead to breakthroughs in biological sciences\nA YC company camfer is applying AI to airfoil design\nThey won a YC-01 hackathon with OpenAI\nAI can increase lift ratio by thinking about airfoil design with certain constraints\nThese are optimistic examples of how AI can increase standard of living…\n01:07:24 – The Issue of Data Access and The Legal Aspects of AI Outputs\nData access for LLMs is a gray area\nSome LLMs buy access or steal access to data\nAt some point it feels like fair use\nFor generated outputs like the airfoil design, it’s unclear if it’s patentable\nGenerated images are not copyrightable\nPeople will take AI outputs and submit patents without disclosing AI use\nIdea: create a startup that reads all patent filings and generates the next logical step\n01:13:34 – The Role of Meta in AI Development\nMeta/Facebook is doing God’s work by spending over $50B and releasing everything open source\nThey put AI in everyone’s faces on Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp\nBut they don’t think about the basic product integration\nThey’re sprinkling it in as a checkbox rather than being unified about it\nThe way we interface with computers is going to totally change\nWhat Anthropic is doing with Claude is important\nEvery major lab will need something similar\nWe’re seeing parent models and child models with distillation happening\nA 1.5 billion parameter model got 84% on the AI-ME math test\nThat’s small enough to fit on anyone’s phone\nWe’re learning day by day that intelligent models will be on desktops and phones\n01:28:07 – The Potential of AI in Decision Making\nAI calling plays in football instead of humans? An AI with o1 Pro could be ahead of human play-callers\nWould know who’s on field, who’s moving slower than normal\nCould see correlations from historical data humans would never pick up\nMight see a crazy speed up because of human effects\nOrganizations make decisions for reasons beyond what they claim\nCorporations do things not for stated reasons but because of power dynamics\nThis is why politics inside companies works against the collective\nAI could be a mayor before becoming a CEO\nBut would rather have a real human being, like with airplane pilots\nEven if autopilot is used 90% of the time, you always need a human in the loop\n01:40:33 – Defining AGI\nIn many domains, it feels like AGI is already here\nAI can have conversations about wine pairings indistinguishable from humans\nAbout 5-10% of things are hitting the Turing test now\nThis year it might go from 10% to 30%\nThe year after it might double again\nThe next few years are actually the golden age of building AI\nHe’s super optimistic about the next five years\nWe’ll discover things, make progress, and impact humanity\n01:42:03 – The Use of AI and Prompting\nJake Heller of Casetext was “the first man on the moon” – first to successfully commercialize GPT-4\nHe got access to GPT-3.5 and started playing with it, and realized it could write a legal argument… but GPT-3.5 hallucinated too much\nWhen GPT-4 came out, it was this transformational leap\nThey built CoCounsel on it\nHe was the first person to successfully productize GPT-4 into a real thing that you can use and trust. And the trick was actually prompting\nIf it hallucinated, it was because you were asking it to do too much in one prompt\nYou had to break the task into a bunch of little prompts\nThey figured out what worked: give it a role, give it instructions, tell it what format the answer should be in, give it the jurisdiction, give it the facts and the issue, and tell it what not to rely on\nDon’t ask it to do too much, and you’ll get deterministic output\nThey analyzed what real lawyers do and replicated it step by step: they use colored flags, highlighters, and they look for a certain type of argument\n01:47:09 – AI Model Reasoning\nHe uses AI with his kids to make stories\no1-pro is extra good now\nDeepSeek-R1 is one of the first open source versions of reasoning models\nWhat Jake Heller did by breaking into chain of thoughts maps to how reasoning models work\nReasoning models do these steps in the background for o1 and o3\nIn Chat GPT you see a summary of the steps\nIn open source models like DeepSeek-R1, you can see pages of the model talking to itself\nIt’s asking “does this make sense?” and breaking things down into steps\nWhat was manual before is now happening automatically in reasoning models\nThat’s what happens with test time compute – spending more time thinking before output\n01:49:48 – The Competitive Advantage in AI\nThe model itself is not the moat – the evals are the moat\nA good prompt engineer will have better golden evals\nBut Sam Altman tells startups to count on models getting better\nAn advantage might last this year but not past it\nEven with GPT-4/03, other advantages still apply\nBuilding a good user experience is critical\nCreating something that professionals recognize as made for them\n“The second best software in the world for everything is using ChatGPT, because you can basically copy and paste almost any workflow or any data.”\nThe first best is a great UI made by good designers and engineers\nYou still have to build good software, sell, retain customers\nBut now you might only need 6 people instead of 1000\n01:52:42 – Investing in Big Tech Companies\nIf investing 100% of net worth in 3 companies: 50% in NVIDIA 30% in Microsoft 20% in Meta\n50% in NVIDIA\n30% in Microsoft\n20% in Meta\nNVIDIA has an outright advantage now\n“I think that the demand for building the infrastructure for intelligence in society is going to be absolutely massive. And maybe on the order of the Manhattan Project, and we just haven’t really thought about it enough.”\nLevel 4 innovators could be “the meta project” – the Manhattan Project of creating more Manhattan Projects\nEnergy is the bigger problem – the limit will be climate crisis and available energy\nIf we can provide unlimited clean energy, that changes everything\nEven with universal basic robotics, energy access is the defining question\n01:55:47 – The Role of Microsoft and Meta in AI\nMicrosoft has deep access to OpenAI\nA large percentage of Microsoft’s market cap is predicated on Sam Altman and OpenAI’s success\nMeta is the dark horse because they’re amassing talent and have crazy distribution\nNever count Zuckerberg out\nZuck is always thinking about the next version of computing\nHe might have put too much money into AR prematurely\nAI for a fraction of what he put into AR is likely to push forward all of humanity\nWill accelerate technological progress in a profound way\n01:57:00 – Learning from MrBeast: YouTube Channel Optimization\nHe met with MrBeast who was very direct: “your titles suck and your thumbnails are even worse”\nMrBeast understands the YouTube algorithm completely\nFor titles – unfortunately it’s clickbait\nTrying to make smart content is tricky because you want clicks from smart people\nThey title episodes differently on YouTube than on audio feed\nFor thumbnails – a person looking into camera helps a lot\nNeed something recognizable when someone sees it\nShould have a distinct thumbnail style\nIf posting regularly, it’s important to have consistent recognizable style\nYouTube is about discovery – you get an audience but don’t keep it\nIf you’re regular and shameless about asking for subs, it helps\nSubs do very little – liking helps more, but watch time helps most\nThe extreme hack is asking for like, subscribe, and hitting the bell icon\n02:05:58 – The Perception of Founders\nHe learned from Paul Graham to be plain spoken and aware of artifice/bullshit\nIt’s easy to care too much about followers and vanity metrics\nFocus on signal-to-noise ratio\nGreat ideas aren’t thinking out loud but figuring out complex concepts and saying them in few words\nPaul spends days or weeks on essays, iterating and getting feedback\nWriting is thinking\nAt YC they help founders with their two-sentence pitch\nIt’s like a mantra or special incantation – you believe something nobody else does\nYou need to breathe that belief into others in as few words as possible\nPeople do complex things but need to explain what they do in one sentence\n02:08:23 – The Reality of Startup Success Rates\nThe median YC startup still fails\nYC might be the most successful institution of its kind\nBut the failure rate is absolutely insane\nA very small percentage create companies worth $50-100B\nThe remarkable thing isn’t that the success rate is low\nIt’s remarkable that it happens at all\n02:09:34 – The Impact of OpenAI\nSam Altman probably brought forward the future by 5-10 years\nSome critics point out that the transformer was made by other teams\nThose researchers did incredible things\nBut Sam and team believed something nobody else believed and brought resources to bear\n02:11:46 – The Golden Age of Building\nWe’re in the first pitch of the first inning of what’s about to happen\nIt’s going to be a great time for humanity and technology\nThe people in the trenches doing the work aren’t attacking their competition\nWe’re in the golden age of building\n“I’m so excited to be alive right now. So lucky, so blessed to be a witness to this. And I think we’re going to make so much progress on so many things.”"

He’s also a fellow Airbnb alumnus along with Lenny and started the original Airbnb growth team.\nIf I drill down what makes companies fail, it’s quite simple. It’s just like they don’t talk to users, which means they don’t find product-market fit. And if they don’t find product-market fit, nothing else really matters. What mistakes  people make is all about that. It’s all about talking to customers and learning that you’re building something that’s actually useful. YC Slack headline is “Make things people want,” and it’s still true and it’s always going to be true.\nIf I drill down what makes companies fail, it’s quite simple.

Folks were diverse, including former founders and people outside the technology industry, which contributed to better decision-making and a YC-like mindset.\nAirbnb felt like a group of friends with a special bond working on a project rather than a job.

The second thing was to understand their true motivations and make sure they mapped to the company’s core values. Airbnb did this through “culture interviews.”\nThe most important thing Airbnb looked for in early hires is how excited they were to be there.

Airbnb did this through “culture interviews.”\nhttps://twitter.com/gustaf/status/1580330162725347330\nMotivations for starting companies ▶️\n“I disagree with Elad Gil that starting up is an act of desperation; most founders start from a positive place.”\n“I disagree with Elad Gil that starting up is an act of desperation; most founders start from a positive place.”\nMotivations can be diverse: solving technical problems, proving oneself, having a grand mission, or simply wanting to be successful. Motivation doesn’t necessarily determine success, and we have seen motivations change over time, e.g. just running the company and enjoying the process of building something big, even if the idea is not grand or shiny.\nMotivations can be diverse: solving technical problems, proving oneself, having a grand mission, or simply wanting to be successful.

Did you hit the goals? If not, what came in the way of hitting the goals?”\nAddresses the loneliness of the founders by allowing them to lean on others who share similar problems and anxieties.\nAddresses the loneliness of the founders by allowing them to lean on others who share similar problems and anxieties.\nCreates accountability by having founders share their goals and progress every two weeks.\nCreates accountability by having founders share their goals and progress every two weeks.\nFounders in coworking spaces should schedule time to talk, because by default they end up working by themselves with headphones on and no time for interaction. YC’s best experiences were in person, with everyone paying attention to each other without distractions.\nCommon reasons startups fail ▶️\nFailing to find product-market fit because they don’t talk to customers:\nFailing to find product-market fit because they don’t talk to customers:\nOften because they think software is the solution to everything, or because they’re afraid of rejection. Ninety percent of customers are not early adopters, so they’re not incentivized to take risks and try something new, and you need to reach out to 10 customers to be able to find that one.\nExternal validation (e.g. investments, praise) is often confused with product-market fit, leading to neglect of customer input. One of the most important moments in Airbnb history was Paul Graham asking the founders of Airbnb, “Where are your customers?,” to which they said, “Oh, they’re in New York,” and Graham responded, “So why are you talking to me and not in New York right now talking to them?”\n2.  Lacking technical knowledge: Startups need technical founders who can build the first prototype.\nKey advice: Talk to customers, learn what they want, and build products that address their needs.\nThe importance of solving pain points and why you should watch users ▶️\nFounders fear that users will try their product and hate it, but the most common thing that happens is the user is indifferent. So if you make improvements and come back after a while, they’ll always give you a second chance. Airbnb started with air mattresses and iterated from there, and Brian Chesky continues to do that today .\nFounders fear that users will try their product and hate it, but the most common thing that happens is the user is indifferent.

One good indicator, though, is if every Office Hours there are new things to talk about (progress on a weekly timescale).\nAre successful founders more focused on...?\nSpeed vs. quality: It’s a false choice. If you know what the customer wants, you’ll come up with something that’s high-quality and move fast. Confidence vs. humility: Successful founders need both to motivate and attract employees, investors, and customers. Execution and tactics vs. strategy: Execution is most important pre-product-market fit, while strategy comes into play afterward, where multiple tasks can be tackled simultaneously. Autocratic vs. collaboration-driven: In early-stage startups with small teams, autocratic decision-making is not feasible. Be willing to adhere to the agreed-upon process. Cares more about product vs. distribution: Early-stage founders should care more about product (from the user’s perspective, not the founder’s), but the growth mindset is very useful when something is working.\nSpeed vs. quality: It’s a false choice.

This is Jason Jacobs and welcome to My Climate Journey. This show follows my journey to interview a wide range of guests to better understand and make sense of the formidable problem of climate change and try to figure out how people like you and I can help. Jason Jacobs:                Hello, everyone. Jason here. Today's guest is Gustaf Alstromer, a partner at Y Combinator who's involved with their carbon investing and also the former product lead of growth at Airbnb. In this episode we cover a number of topics, including what Y Combinator is up to with their carbon investing, Gustaf's role, some of the history that lead to them getting involved in this carbon investing, as well as an in depth look at some of the companies that they've backed so far and what they look for in climate focused startups. I left this conversation with a much better idea of how Y Combinator is thinking about these issues. And hopefully it'll be helpful to any aspiring entrepreneurs that are doing work in this area in terms of thinking through whether Y Combinator might be a fit. Without further ado, here's Gustaf. Gustaf, welcome to the show. Gustaf A.:                     Thank you so much, Jason. Jason Jacobs:                Well, I'm glad you're here. We had one meeting out in San Francisco, gosh, probably a few months ago now. But we've been emailing a bunch and you've pointed some deal flow my way and I feel like you're kind of a fellow traveler for me at this point in my climate journey. Gustaf A.:                     Yeah. I feel like I'm on a journey, too. It's been going on for a while, but there's so much new things to learn that I feel like you're constantly learning when you're in this space. Jason Jacobs:                So maybe that's where we should start. I'm super curious, I don't think I asked you this question when we met, either, that your background looks kind of like my background. You grew up in consumer internet and now you're doing climate stuff. So how did that come about for you? How did that come about for YC? How did you guys get here? Gustaf A.:                     Sure. I just want to ... I'm not doing 100% climate or [inaudible 00:02:09]. That's not really what I'm working on at YC. But I am involved with some of the things that we have funded. But it's not something that takes up most of my time. But I've been thinking about it for a long time and I've been actively trying to fund companies that work on these problems. So I will talk about that for sure. Gustaf A.:                     So my background, I came to the US a long time ago. I grew up in Sweden and most recently before Y Combinator, so Y Combinator I've been at for about 2 years as a partner and before that I worked as, initially, a PM and then started the growth team at Airbnb, worked on that team and built it from just a few people to a large team over almost 5 years. The one thing I would say ... and the previous company before that was called Voxer, it was a walkie-talkie app. So both Airbnb and Voxer was consumer companies for sure and I worked on product and growth for both of them. Gustaf A.:                     The one thing I would say- Jason Jacobs:                And they both got big, right? Gustaf A.:                     Both of them got pretty big, although Airbnb is got bigger than Voxer. But the one thing I learned at Airbnb is how valuable the scientific method can be for building product and doing growth. I.E, basically there's a bunch of data and then you can learn something on data and the data tells you what to do next. And we utilized that a lot in the growth team at Airbnb. And a lot of growth and the science of growth, in my opinion, is just math. So you add up a bunch of different choices of traffic and how it converts, and then you do the calculations and you decide what to work on. Gustaf A.:                     I think that climate is very similar. It is very much a problem of math, a systemic problem, but it's something that ... where math plays an important role. Understanding what are the huge sources of emissions, how much does it cost to replace them with something new? So the idea of a carbon tax or price on carbon, all of these things in some sense is quite similar in the sense that you use math to figure out what to do next and what's important. But I would have to say that's one of the things that connects these two things together. Besides that, I don't actually remember what made me curious about climate, but I've always been very curious about new technology. And I was particularly curious about how new to tech could help solve climate change. How everything from carbon removal to de-carbonization technologies like electric cars. All of this stuff has always fascinated me. Gustaf A.:                     So that's, I guess, my background. I have a very pragmatic view on how to solve things and I do believe that industry plays a very, very important role in this. Even though there's a systemic and some political solution to it, but I do think the industry plays a very big, important role. Jason Jacobs:                And you mentioned that this stuff is only one aspect of your role at Y Combinator, so what are you doing at YC? Gustaf A.:                     Yeah. So I joined as a partner about two years ago. Twice a year we fund lots of startups, often the first money in and the first time those companies start working on their startups. And we have a program where we fund all kinds of companies now in every single category and they do our program for three to four months after that. And doing that program, we help them immensely. The most important thing is what should they be doing during those three months is [inaudible 00:05:03] things that you can do as a new start up founder, and we try to focus them as much as we can. And then at the end of the program we help companies with fund raising. So hopefully after those three or four months, the companies have raised funding and continue growing as a startup.So for most of the time at YC, I work with these companies, typically between 30 and 40 companies, for those three or four months, twice a year. Gustaf A.:                     Between that, we have a long interview process and we have a bunch of other things that we do. And one of the things that we did, which was about a year ago or a little less than a year ago, was we put up some requests for start ups. And this has been around for a long time within Y Combinator, where we publish a website, ycombinator.com/rfs, where we just list the problems that we think are important to work on as an inspiration for people to start start ups to work on those problems. And it serves two purposes, one is it actually inspires people to work on those things and two, it tells the world that we're actively trying to fund companies that work on these things. And sometimes when we say we fund everything, sometimes people still think that \"The thing that I'm working on isn't included in everything. So I'd better not apply because they will never accept me anyway.\" So that's the dual purposes of the request for start up document. Gustaf A.:                     And about a year ago, we put carbon removal technologies as one of the topics. And I was surprised how much interest we got from that post. And then a few months later we put something called carbon.ycombinator.com where we published a bunch of ideas of more radical or more out there ideas on how you can remove carbon from the atmosphere. And it just after that we got lots of people to apply with ideas to remove carbon from the atmosphere. Gustaf A.:                     We've been funding de-carbonization technologies for a long time. Everything from electric flights to solar panel companies, to all kinds of things, chemical companies. So we've been doing this for quite a while. But the specific focus on removing carbon from the atmosphere was something that we added about a year ago and that's been very exciting since then. Jason Jacobs:                And looking at all the different areas that could affect climate change and de-carbonization, what made you focus on carbon removal? Gustaf A.:                     Primarily because it was ... not a lot of people were focusing on this. I came to the conclusion that we absolutely need to do, as a society, both de-carbonize and remove carbon from the atmosphere. We have to do both. It's simply not enough to do just one of them. And there are lots of things in the world that we don't have any good ideas on how to de-carbonize. So everything from steal production to concrete to flying across the globe, all kinds of things that are very difficult to de-carbonize. And in addition to that, I think the accuracy reports, nearly all of them, suggest that there's a huge amount of carbon removal that is require. It's often not really specified how it's going to happen. Historically people have just talked about \"Oh, we need to plant some more trees or do what we've done in the past.\" I think there are many different categories of technologies in carbon removal that I find fascinating. But we've funded a couple of companies and I will be more than happy to talk about them in a second. But I think mostly because other people weren't doing it, we knew that it was required, and ... yeah that's probably why we decided to focus on that. Gustaf A.:                     If it turned out that carbon removal technologies had a breakthrough, then that would be very big because it is the one thing that matters to all de-carbonization, is we find a cheaper way of removing carbon from the atmosphere. That wasn't necessarily the goal, but it is a very impactful thing if we can get the cost of removing carbon from our atmosphere down to a low number. Jason Jacobs:                Yeah, if you don't mind, maybe that's a nice lead in to ... it'd be great if you could talk a little bit about the some of the companies you've backed in this area. Just so that me and the listeners can get some context for what types of companies do this carbon removal and what types of companies get you guys excited in this area. Gustaf A.:                     Yeah. So in the last batch that ended just two months ago we had two companies. The first one is called Pachama. Pachama was founded by two founders. One of the founders was a YC alum, Diego, and he had previously started a company making one of the first smart suitcases in the world. After he came back and we started talking to him about starting Pachama, he came to me with the idea this is his life's work. This is the thing he wanted to do for the significant amount time going forward. And he wanted to have real impact. He grew up in Latin America and had seen the deforestation of that part of the world. And he wanted to figure out how you can incentivize farmers to either not cut down the trees or to reforest the land that previously had been deforested. And what was lacking was a clear incentive for those farmers on how to do this. They didn't know exactly why they would do that. Gustaf A.:                     Now in several parts of the world, the European Union, parts of the US, California, and soon China, there are existing carbon markets where you can get paid to either remove or in some cases avoid carbon from being emitted in the atmosphere. And those are things that did not reach those farmers in Latin America. So he wanted to start a new market place for carbon removal. And I think this idea is very ... it's in the center of the whole idea of carbon removal, because if you are a farmer and you have a new idea for a new crop that is extremely efficient at removing carbon from the atmosphere, now somehow you need to get paid. This needs to participate or exist in a market where there's a compliance run by governments or a voluntary market where individuals or companies can participate. Any new idea needs to participate in some market place. Gustaf A.:                     So his idea was to start that market place. It's called Pachama. He's starting with probably one of the biggest, or if not the biggest, opportunity for carbon removal, which is planting trees. So trees have an enormous opportunity to remove carbon, both by not taking trees down and also by reforesting land. Now the challenging part has been how do you measure how much carbon is being stored in those trees and how do you pay out the money and who gets paid for what. So his platform solves all of these things and they use satellite technology and machine learning to try to predict the carbon intensity in a forest. And then as a result of that, they're able to pay out to those farmers as they're storing carbon in their forest. So that voluntary carbon price is somewhere between I believe $8 and $15. And that's how much you can get paid per ton of CO2 that they can prove you are storing in your forest. So they're launching very soon. They've got an enormous amount of interest from buyers. Gustaf A.:                     So what I can tell for sure is that, and this we knew before, is that there is a very big interest for lots of participants in society to actually go carbon neutral. It just hasn't been very easy to do so. And one of the companies that we looked at was Strike. If you go to strike.com/environment, they'll talk in detail how they went carbon neutral. And I know that it's easy. It's not easy to do that in an organization, which it shouldn't be that complicated. Gustaf A.:                     So that's the first company, Pachama. The second company is called Prometheus Fuels. If you are familiar with carbon engineering, this is a very similar outcome where the input is energy and it's CO2 and it's water, and the output is fuel. And fuel in the sense that this is the kind of gasoline, high performance gasoline, that you can run in a car. And he also [inaudible 00:12:02]. He hasn't been as public as Pachama about what he's working on, but it's basically a similar idea. And the whole purpose of Prometheus is that he will produce fuel and in return get public field credit so he can sell it cheaper and eventually sell it at market price. And that's a hard thing to do. If there is even a small chance that that would work, it would be a no brainer investment for an investor because the potential value by creating cheaper fuel than gasoline is ... you can even imagine how they get this. So if there's any chance that something like that might actually succeed, then that's very interesting for us. Gustaf A.:                     So those are the two companies we funded in the last batch and both of them focus on removing carbon from the atmosphere in some way. Jason Jacobs:                Mm-hmm (affirmative). So those companies have a similar mission, but look very different from each other in terms of the actual solution. So do they get put through the same process with the same people as the rest of the Y Combinator companies or is there a different set of expertise and/or a different process required? Gustaf A.:                     So we don't have a specific track for climate change or carbon removal. What we do is we break up the batch in a number of groups. So typically we have four or five groups. And some groups are focused on hardware, some of the focus on bioengineering or bio track, and many of them are just focused on consumer and BDB and SAS. So the most likely outcome if you apply with a more hardware oriented idea is that you get put in a group with a bunch of other companies, or maybe even a subgroup of other chemical companies. [inaudible 00:13:24] market place, you might actually be put in a group with other market place companies, or in Diego's case with other SAS companies because he affectively sells to business. That's where we're like \"That's the customer.\" Gustaf A.:                     There's nothing special about the carbon removal. I think what we wanted to accomplish is we actually wanted to fund founders who are passionate about these ideas, but to make them be exactly like all the other companies. That they would learn all the other things that all the other companies learn. There was no purpose in treating them differently in my opinion. I think we need to treat them the same, and specific we need to make sure that they understand that the commercial expectations of them from the market after us are the same. There will be some optimistic investors, for sure, that are more passionate about this. But if you treating these companies as something else than commercial companies, then I think it will only hurt them in the long run. Jason Jacobs:                Mm-hmm (affirmative). And so how do you evaluate ... and I guess there's factors in terms of the traditional software investing that is more capital efficient and can compress the timelines to scale, and then some of the areas of climate change, at least the ones that I've been looking at, they're more science realist, they're more capital intensive, there's more of a time horizon. So how do you guys think about that when evaluating the right fit for YC from this area? Gustaf A.:                     Well, one of the things we think about is what are the chances that this company would raise money [inaudible 00:14:41]? If you have a two assign ... if you're half way through your research and you have two years ahead of yourself going forward and at the end of the day you will have nothing to show but some science, in general it's harder to get those companies funded. So I think it's pretty important that during YC you spend quite a bit of time trying to think about what are the commercial aspects of what you're doing. Even if you're going to do science for continuous times, then thinking of what the commercial impact of what you're doing I think is really important. And that's sort of true for a category like your biotech companies. You might have a drug on the market for several years, but it's really important that they start thinking in terms of who are the customers, what does the FDA process look like, et cetera. Gustaf A.:                     So I think we think about it in the same way for these companies. I would argue that even if you had a great technology for say, using oceans to remove carbon from the atmosphere, it's unclear today, even if it was ready to go, how you take that to market. It's not clear that there is anything obvious to plug into. And I think it's better that we first build infrastructure where these technologies can plug into where the money is flowing. And I think this is why one of the reasons I'm so excited for this is I think that the world will just come to its senses and start realizing that paying for fixing climate change is going to cost a lot of money. And that money is going to have to flow through a bunch of systems into either de-carbonization or to removing carbon from the atmosphere. And there's going to have a lot of new companies because we knew the companies in the past either don't exist or they're just not very good. And we need to have a software revolution in these companies as well. Gustaf A.:                     So going back to that example of someone coming up with a new idea, storing carbon in the oceans, for example. It needs to plug into a system where there's money flowing into that technology to remove carbon. It needs to be easy to verify, transparent, and all those things. And this is sort of like what carbon removal or carbon offset markets have had a challenge with in the past. Gustaf A.:                     So I believe that there are a lot of opportunities right now to do things that are not super expensive. Even in the case of Prometheus, they're not building big factories like carbon engineering. They're building small machines. Jason Jacobs:                How do you go about diligencing these companies? Given ... it sounds from your stated focus like you're a generalist organization. So does the diligence process in climate resemble the diligence process in any other aspects of YC that you're actively investing in or do you find that a different process is needed there? Gustaf A.:                     No, it's the same. It's the same. The most important diligence is on the founders themselves because so many of the companies that come to YC don't really have something that's working. But besides that, we were asking people to submit a demo, we were asking people to submit videos of the things that they're working on and see if it's working. And to the extent we have to do more scientific diligence, we do that too. And we have some people that are involved that have expertise and background in that. But we're not taking the same level of diligence that let's say a large firm would have, because we just simply don't have the time. We learned so much about these companies during the batch that that in some sense ... if someone was lying about what they were doing when they applied, it would be very clear during the next four months because we will meet with you every week for four months. Gustaf A.:                     But the most important diligence is on the founders themselves and what is their background. Do they seem credible to be able to do something like this? But it's not ... we are a little bit different than other firms in that we fund primarily people, and that's what we do when we fund them. And then in many cases they become companies during the batch, but they weren't necessarily fully figured out companies when they applied to YC. Jason Jacobs:                How do you think about ... maybe this is a different frame than you think, but I think about the insiders that have been working on climate for decades. And then the people like you and I that are the opposite of fair weather fans, we only come in when things get really bad. So how do you think about that when you look at your founding teams in this area? How important is industry, expertise? Gustaf A.:                     A really good question and something I've been spending a lot of time thinking about. Because many of the founders who apply look a little bit different here. They have a different background. And I don't want to be too generalizing here, but I would say that being say someone with experience from Silicon Valley, I think it's actually very helpful here in terms of how quickly can you move into a working prototype, how quickly can you try to figure out the commercial value of what you're building, how lean can you make your operation. Many of the aspects that I would say have been good to entrepreneurships that come out of Silicon Valley, I think that I want to see more of in these companies. It doesn't mean that you have to move extremely fast or skip things in order to get things done, but that's one thing that there was a lack of. And some of the best founders, in my experience, are ... many of the people that work for software startups actually don't have a software background. They might have studied physics or chemical engineering or mechanical engineering in university. But when they came to the job market then it was Facebook, and it was Airbnb and it was Strike and all these companies they ended up working for. But that's actually not what their initial passion was. Gustaf A.:                     So that's a quite common background that I see, is that some already actually have the skill sets from the beginning. They've just been doing other things for a while. So there's one of them. Gustaf A.:                     I think for the more research oriented teams it's the commercial viability and how fast you move, and understanding how you can change your funding structure from mostly grants to commercial investors. I think those are the three things that those kind of teams need the most help with. Gustaf A.:                     I've learned a lot about this and I think what I was going to get to when you asked the question was since we've put out this request for startups, I've had probably a few dozen engineers that email me that work at great companies and ask me \"Where should I go to work? I want to work on climate change.\" I've also had extremely successful founders who have emailed us and said \"I'm staring a company. I want to figure out these things.\" So I would say that forward thinking people that see on the horizon what's going to happen are already starting companies and already thinking about this stuff to a very different degree than even just two years ago. Gustaf A.:                     I'm actually very optimistic and the best thing that we can do as an organization at YC is both have the first companies that we fund be commercially successful in that at least do well in financing to show that this is a path through how you can get your financing so you don't have to go route of taking grants from the government. Jason Jacobs:                How much overlap is there between the financing players for these types of companies versus the other companies in YC, the more traditional software or Silicon Valley types of companies? Gustaf A.:                     You'd be surprised how high the overlap is. So I used to describe Demo Day as people that come to Demo Day are in this combination of ... of course there's a bunch of large firms, but in terms of the individual initial investors that come to Demo Day, they are often successful founders who started software companies in the past and now invested some of their own money. It turns out that that type of people are also very excited about stopping climate change. And they are excited about using technology to do that and they actually see that that's a natural evolution. So those are the same people that fund our software companies that don't focus on this at all. Gustaf A.:                     So I would actually argue that it's exactly the same audience. There are some funds that are specifically focused on this, but they are not the majority of the investors. And if you look on, for example, we've had companies doing electric airplanes that are being funded by the same kind of people that fund other software companies. We've had a number of other companies in green energy, for example, and it's often funded by the same type of investors. I actually think that that's the strength of our Demo Day is that we have a different set of investors where you don't need to go to some various expected five or ten investors in your category and have a very long diligence process, that things can move a bit faster. And I think that's a huge strength of Demo Day and of YC in general. Just like you don't need to the typical type of investors with expertise in that category, you just need any set of investors. Maybe it sounds dangerous, but I don't think that at all. Jason Jacobs:                I think it's pretty new so maybe there's not enough data yet, but how does that look downstream once you get into later stage growth type of rounds? Gustaf A.:                     This is a great question. The short answer is we don't know yet. Similarly, we've funded many, many new areas or categories of the world in technology. Each one of them had to be figured out by research investors. So the thing that's on the news right now is Latin America where suddenly there's lots of money flowing into Latin America. When we started funding Latin American companies, there was nothing. There was almost no local investors and there was no US investors who ever would fly to Latin American founded companies. Africa is the same thing where we've founded now a number of very, very successful companies that are reaching to those B stage, maybe later. And I don't think that US investors are flying to Africa to fund them, so we need to have a new investment ecosystem there. And the best thing that we can do is just to train investors, the late stage investors, where they should be looking and then I would tell them right now \"You should be looking at Latin America, looking at Africa. There are some extremely healthy companies, just based on their numbers doing really well.\" Gustaf A.:                     And I think the same would happen for these kind of companies that as long as they remain focused on the commercial outcome and they're trying to make money while stopping climate change at the same time, the same type of investors that fund the software companies will eventually fund them. Maybe in the hardware case, it might be a little bit different. But for anything that's not entirely hardware, I think it will be very similar. Gustaf A.:                     Equally, I mentioned that I had a bunch of software engineers who talk to us, we've also had enormous amount of press and an enormous amount of investors that just wanted to learn about how to fund the companies in this space. So I've been very optimistic, just by the response from people I did not expect after we put out the request for startups about carbon removal and people that wanted to get into this space in some way. And I realized that YC had some amount of influence, so I'm happy that this is happening. Jason Jacobs:                And when you say investors want to learn how to invest in companies in this space, earlier in this discussion you'd said that that's not different. So is it different and if so how? Gustaf A.:                     Well, for a company like Pachama, I don't think it's different. I think what they're saying is that they're saying that there's a market need, which is people and companies who want to go carbon neutral. And just like there's a market need for a bunch of other things right now in the world, some things that may be known and some things may not be known to investors, there's a market need for this. And I have a little bit of an advantage of coming from the Nordic countries where I see this market need being stronger than in many other places. The Nordic countries and then parts of Europe, and then California is probably where this market need for stopping climate change feels the strongest in the general discussion. And you feel a very different thing when you have to travel to India or travel to Indonesia or travel to other places where this is not a general topic that people are talking about in the same way. Gustaf A.:                     So if the world would go in the direction of parts of California or the Nordic countries, the market need for everything that companies and consumers need to make their part in solving climate change is going to come from, then as an investor you just have to kind of discover this market need and believe in it, and then figure out who are the companies who are best suited to serve it. Gustaf A.:                     For example, let's say you are a company who wants to go carbon neutral. I doesn't have to be a software company. It can be a large retailer of some kind. And there are many of them. Now if that's a market need, how do you do it? Well, you need to account for how much carbon you're emitting and then you have to find an easy, trustworthy, and transparent solution to pay for it, and then go carbon neutral. And then you have to figure out what are the best companies to do that? Gustaf A.:                     I would argue that market need of companies and individuals wanting to go carbon neutral is actually very large and the market is massively untapped, we just need better companies to do it. And I tend to ask people \"What are the five companies you can mention before you've heard of Pachama, that would do this?\" And no one can mention any companies. So people can't even think of what would be a good provider of that service of trying to make your organization go carbon neutral. And that to me suggests, as everything, that there is just not enough good companies working on these things. And as an investor, once you figure that out I don't think the rest is that different. I mean, there is some regulatory thing here that is going to play in and to the extent that companies will ... let's take companies who, as an example, will go carbon neutral because of demands from their boards or from their customers or from the government, I don't really know what will be the driving force. Maybe it'll be different forces in different parts of the world. But certainly there are regulatory driving forces in parts of the world, especially in Europe. And then you just need the most trustworthy and cheapest way to do it. Jason Jacobs:                For the Pachama type of companies, I think that makes sense. Some of the other companies, I don't know if you've funded any in this area, but that were on your request for start ups, the types of solutions they feel almost more geoengineering focused where it's not nearly as similar, at least on the surface, to the more traditional companies that you guys have backed over the years. So in those circumstances, do different rules apply? And I guess as a follow up to that as well, where does regulation fit in and who should be the ultimate arbiter one when these technologies are ready to be commercialized so that for example, we can avoid unintended consequences that could actually be harmful to society? Gustaf A.:                     That's a good question. I don't think that we're trying to ... obviously like with anything you do in the world, there are potentially things that you can't predict. I don't think that we're trying to fund geoengineering. But let's say you are working with five scientists and you're figuring out a fungi that is extremely good at capturing carbon. And there is a safe place where that can survive, and that at the cost compared to other efforts, it would be an extremely efficient way for humanity to remove carbon from the atmosphere. I believe that you would probably fund that if you believe that it's extremely effective. Let's say you're geo modifying a tree that is 10x more efficient at capturing carbon. There's going to have to be somebody that regulates that. I don't expertise for every country in the world which body that would be. But sure, I don't think that ... I'm certain that the founders of Pachama for example did not want to create mono cultures of biodiversity just because they're paying people to remove carbon. So ultimately, I think it's a shared responsibility of governments and these companies. Gustaf A.:                     But I think in some the more out there proposals that we had on carbon.ycombinator.com, the idea was more to inspire a different set of people to work on these things that typically wouldn't even explore it. Because I do think that there are other disciplines, especially chemical engineering and bio engineering, where they can actually make a huge impact into some of these technologies. We just haven't really seen it yet. Gustaf A.:                     So that was initially the idea why we did it. It was that we wanted to inspire a different set of people to come up with these new ideas. Gustaf A.:                     I think it's important to work on just tradition carbon removal for now because if we don't do that and if we don't stop climate change, I think there is a risk that some countries will eventually take on much more riskier solutions when they're countries are under water. So it's very important that we work on the things that we know are safe right now. And planting trees is safe. And maybe of the thing that's these companies are working on is extremely safe. It's unsafe to do what we've been doing for the last few hundred years. But if we don't do them, I think there's a higher risk that people will take to more riskier bets. And that is not something we would fund, but I can see how some desperate people or desperate countries would do that. Jason Jacobs:                Well, one counter argument that I've heard is that there's a difference between funding deployment of these technologies versus funding research. And that by not funding research, it's actually making it harder to regulate appropriately to keep those rogue nations from doing that because the regulatory bodies wouldn't really understand its capabilities or its limitations. How do you think about that? Do you draw that similar distinguishment, if that's a word, from deployment to research? And do you have a different opinion about the research? Or where do you come out? Gustaf A.:                     I don't think we had a great experience with funding research as part of our program. It's just not something ... it typically doesn't go- Jason Jacobs:                But your program aside, I'm more getting at should this research be funded by somebody and are you a proponent of that personally? Gustaf A.:                     Oh, I don't even know if I've thought of that. I mean, I haven't thought about it too deeply. I'm not inherently opposed to it for any specific reason. I haven't thought about that question in particular. But I would say that there is a lack of money in research and the question whether that's going to come from private or government is an interesting one. I would love to see a lot more money coming form the government into these things for sure. And I think we don't really get involved until there is at least some idea of what the market might be. Gustaf A.:                     And I know there's been a lot of interest in YC funding research because we've funded research in the past with a universal income basic study. I don't think in this case that we are the best organization set up to do this. I think we're a great organization set up to take research ideas that are ready to go into market into the market and to investors. I think that's what we do really well. I don't think that we're set up to fund research right now in that space. Yeah, I wish we were. But I don't think we are. Jason Jacobs:                Well, I heard somewhere that you were encouraging people maybe working on nonprofit initiatives in this area. Is that true? Gustaf A.:                     Yes. So we've funded nonprofits for a while. We have a couple learnings from funding nonprofits. The first nonprofit that we funded was Watsi and that was 2013. So it's been about 6 years since we started funding nonprofits. The thing that we have learned nonprofits is to have a really, really big impact on society, relying on donors is not a good way to have that impact. It's possible, it's just not a great way. So it's better, even if you're nonprofit, to rely on revenue where you're charging someone for something. Or at least you're not relying on big money donors, so you have to go out and spend most of the year raising funding or applying to grants. It doesn't scale very well. It works well when you're maybe 2 or 3 people, but when you're a few hundred people it doesn't work well. Gustaf A.:                     The second thing that we've learned is technology can play a huge impact into nonprofits. So not a criteria, but a very common thread among the nonprofits we've funded the last couple years, has been that they use technology to achieve their goals. So an example of that is Tarjimly. Tarjimly is a platform where volunteers can translate for refugees in refugee camps. All they need to have is a phone with Facebook messenger and the same has to happen on the other end, and you can be, within a minute, a volunteer translator for a refugee. That's a technology driven nonprofit. There's no way you can make a profit off refugees. And that's something that works really well that we've been able to fund. Gustaf A.:                     I think there are historical set up nonprofits that we're unlikely to fund because of how they look and the structure and the things that I mentioned. It doesn't mean that are opposed to nonprofits, but I think that in some cases when people apply to nonprofit, we try to question them and be like \"Are you sure that this is best done as a nonprofit if your goal is to achieve change in the world?\" And we try to convince them to do either a for profit or something in between. Jason Jacobs:                What was it? There was a pretty well known political one that you guys took in as part of your class a year or two ago, right? Which one was that? Gustaf A.:                     Well, we funded ACLU and we funded vote.org. Jason Jacobs:                That's the one I was thinking of. Is there a comparable in the climate fight and would that be interesting? If Sunrise Movement came to you guys, would you have a reaction to them? Or Extinction Rebellion or any of these other grass roots? Gustaf A.:                     I think ACLU was the one exception in the top of nonprofits that we've funded. It doesn't actually look like most of the ones that we fund on a regular basis. We funded Good Food Institute in a similar way, where they are focusing on promoting plant based and clean meat in the world. If a climate change or carbon removal nonprofit came to us, and like I mentioned they weren't well trained at running on big donors and they use technology in some way, then absolutely I think we would consider it. I don't think that we do very well for nonprofits that look like a traditional nonprofit, where the entire goal of YC is to raise more donations. I don't think that we help them very much. Unless they have a very strong ambition to change into something else. But sure. I think that we should do that. We're open to. Gustaf A.:                     I would argue that nonprofit is often viewed as the way to have big change in the world without being conflicted about your profit motives. But in many of the cases of the things that we've funded, the profit motive is completely aligned with a long term change you want in the world. I think that there are many companies that we've funded, the clean meat company is in there, that their goal is to make plant based food and clean meat. And they are doing that for profit, which I think Beyond Meat went public the other week, and is a great example of how you can have a really ambitious plan which has potentially a massive effect for our climate, and be a for profit company. Where I think that people are making a mistake if they start thinking that good for the world means more nonprofit. I think that's a huge mistake. Jason Jacobs:                I agree to some extent. I think the ... well, I do agree. But one thing I worry about is that the interest can align with your business model and mission for some time or maybe even for a long time, but it isn't guaranteed that it always will. And I think Facebook's a good example of that, where at some point there's no guarantee that they won't be at odds. And it's actually likely that at some point they will be at odds, and I think that's really where the friction occurs. And I'm not necessarily saying that means that you can't have a huge impact in the private sector, but it's just personally something that I worry about. Gustaf A.:                     I'd rather have Facebook with great regulation than no Facebook and a bunch of nonprofits trying to do the same thing. I just think that in that case it was probably a regulatory failure partly. Again, I want to ... I'll give a very concrete example. So if you're a nonprofit, how are you going to hire engineers? Well, you're limited to the engineers that are interested in working for nonprofits and are not interested in the motive of getting good salary or good equity. So that limits the number of people you can hire, which in term limits the impact you can have in this conversation. So there are many down sides to it and I think people should be aware of those downsides and do a nonprofit if that's the only thing that you can do to impact that type of change. But in many other cases, I think having a for profit is not in the short term at least, in conflict with what you are trying to accomplish. Jason Jacobs:                I have just a couple other quick questions on the YC side and then maybe one personal question. On the YC side, just one question is where government fits in. Let me stop there. Where does government fit into this equation? The ARPA-E’s with grants or ... because I know some of the harder tech types of opportunities, often times the non-dilutive grant capital can be an important mechanism. And so how do you guys think about that? Gustaf A.:                     Yeah. So many of the companies, especially in biotech, for example, have relied on grant money from big national organizations in the carbon space that can amount in something similar. I don't think that we will have a very active government relations, if that makes sense. I think we'll meet with government organizations on a regular basis, but I don't think they will have an active ... usually I don't think that that is the critical point that makes these companies successful. Jason Jacobs:                Is that a stage thing where it will be very important later on, presuming success in these early stages? But that's for the scaling companies and the later stage investors to deal with? Gustaf A.:                     Yeah. I think so. If you look at our experience from Airbnb and the amount of public policy people that we had at Airbnb, there was two or something like when I joined. And there was 300 people at Airbnb when I joined. So it might be a stage thing where these profit teams are something you build up over time. I don't think it's ever a good idea to have critical reliance on government regulations from an early on stage. It's not good. It doesn't mean that selling to governments is a bad business. I actually think that it's a fantastic business that is changing very fast. But you have to be very aware of how government is organized and how slow they are. And they're not necessarily always a great buyer of things. It's not necessarily what I have in mind when I think about government [inaudible 00:38:23] here. I think of more what are the policies and things that need to change, or what are the kind of laws they need to live up to. Gustaf A.:                     In the case of Pachama as an example, to take a very practical one. I'm sure that the thing that matters to them is going to be how do you plug into the large compliance carbon market in the world. That might be very important. Or maybe for both of those companies, or other companies in the future, there might be [inaudible 00:38:46] that fight for more climate rights or a carbon tax or carbon incentives. That might make sense as well for both of them. I don't really know. But in terms of regulatory environment, I think the ... for example, low carbon fuel firms are relatively easy things to figure out. It's not like you need to hire lots of people to figure that out. Gustaf A.:                     So I don't think we have a strong view for these companies in particular, but I would say that ... let me put it this way. From my experience from YC is that the very fastest moving potential customers or partners that you might have are other start ups. Second to that are other companies. And third to that is government. So it's never the fastest moving organization that you want to allow your business on. So it's not something that you would prioritize right away because it involves a huge amount of risk. Gustaf A.:                     So let's say if I was Prometheus Fuels, and I have no idea of this is what they're planning or not, but if I was them and I wanted to try to sell fuel, from the beginning I would do what Impossible Foods do. Which is go to a high end, try to find my customers who are willing to pay a bit more for their fuel if it's carbon neutral, and then go to high end places where I could partner with, maybe Whole Foods or something like that, where you can sell that fuel. Whole Foods is a bad example. Some way of going after the small, niche private market and not trying to go after government right away. Because I think it'll much more difficult. Similar to the Tesla strategy where they went after individuals to sell their first cars, I think is a good way to get started. And if I was Pachama I would go after fast moving start ups with a good conscience and who plan to go carbon neutral, and then maybe bigger companies with the same motive, versus going after and trying to change the government or policies and stuff right away. Because it's going to take a lot longer time, it's a lost more riskier. Jason Jacobs:                And the last YC focused question is more around ... you talked about market base and how the cost would keep coming down as these companies scale. I've heard some people in the industry, actually a number of people, say that for certain types of solutions they're important to the carbon fight, but that until there's a price on the externalities and there's actually a price put on the emissions that some of the other fuels are doing, or at least getting rid of the fossil fuel subsidies, that it won't be a level playing field and the best technology from an emissions standpoint won't win. Do you actively avoid those areas or do you see building into them assuming that at some point that price comes? Gustaf A.:                     Well, I can tell you what I personally believe. I personally believe that the carbon prices are going to go up. So the fees or the taxes around the world are going to go up. And it'll happen country by country or maybe regions by regions, but they will go up. That is my long view of things. Which means that many of these things will ... and there are many governments in the world, so there's many potential markets where this might happen earlier. You look at Tesla in Norway where they have amazing subsidies for electric cars. Electric cars is 50% of the new cars sold. So if you believe it'll happen, albeit slowly, in some markets first, then it's just something that you just take into account that it will happen. And if you look on solar panels that the reason that we have solar panels today that are able to be market competitive with other sources of energy is the combination of the subsidies of Germany and China and what they did for a long period of time in pushing down the cost of the panels being produced. We might need that things for some other technologies. I don't think that investors are going to be excited about investing into something that is on the consumer or buyer level 80% funded by subsidies. I don't think it's the kind of risk that they are willing to take. Gustaf A.:                     I think that rather when we see a scenario, and this the kind of model that I want to see when companies come in and apply to YC, is sort of what are the things that have to turn right for this to be competitive on the market level price? So if you're removing carbon from the atmosphere, how do you make sure that what you're doing actually can beat trees or they can beat solar carbon, or something like that? Because I don't think that you can raise a lot of money ... and we're not the best funder of something that'll cost a billion dollars before you go to market. We're not the kind of organization you should fund that to. You should find another way of funding that. We're not the best one. At least if it's at the end of that, there's a potential of reliance on subsidies. Gustaf A.:                     So yeah, I think we will very quickly start to pay for the higher cost of the carbon that we emit. It's not necessarily a great political strategy in my opinion, but it is a really good market strategy to get industry to do the right thing. And I believe that it will happen. I'm not sure that it will happen in the US right away, but I really believe that it will happen in some market. And many of the companies that I've seen here actually have the Nordic market as some of their first customers. Some of the most progressive say oil companies or energy companies are in Norway. Gustaf A.:                     Oh, yeah. Okay. So it's not just because they're the only countries in the world that care about it. They just happened to be a few years earlier, I think. And it's not crazy that if you make electric airplanes that you sell them to Scandinavia first, because they also seem to care a lot. And gas and fuel are extremely expensive there. So if you have another means of powering your car or your vehicle, then those might be a great market, too. Gustaf A.:                     So yeah, I think it'll happen. I'm not too worried about it. I think you do the best when you don't rely on this, so you have a real ... you have to fight really hard. And I think that we've seen that online again, that people can do a lot more than they think and history is not necessarily a good predictor of how much you are able to achieve in your space. Jason Jacobs:                So my last question, Gustaf, is more of a personal one and it's actually one that I would be interested to ask you with or without the microphone on. But something that I wrestle with is just that this really does feel to me like an existential crisis and it's hard for me to imagine working on anything that isn't related to de carbonization, especially given that I'm fortunate enough to have some flexibility to choose what I work on. And I guess given that this is some percentage of your time but not the full percentage of your time, is that something that you wrestle with? And how much of a pickle do you think we're in? And how do you reconcile those things? Gustaf A.:                     So I'll make an analogy to Sweden. In Sweden there's a huge debate right now whether you should fly at all or you should take the train or the amount of sacrifices you should do in your life to live a carbon free life. I grew up, I've been a vegetarian for 25 years of my life. I recently learned that the percent of vegetarians in society has been steady at 5% for the last hundred years. So for those 25 years I remember there's been many, many, many organizations or for the last hundred, they were fighting for people to become vegetarians. They haven't done so well. They haven't been very successful at convincing others to be vegetarians. Maybe because it's a sacrifice that most people are not willing to do. So I believe that let's say even half of Sweden would make the sacrifice of sacrificing lots in their life to live a less carbon impactful life. I don't think it's something that everybody is willing to do. No matter how much you want that, it's not going to happen. Gustaf A.:                     So what will happen, or what is a better bet in my opinion, is that we come up with a bunch of new technologies that changes the game. If you can grow plant based food or plant based burgers that taste like meat, or grow real meat in a bioreactor, that is the kind of technology change that will make all those people trying to convince people to be vegetarians feel completely obsolete. Because you don't need to do that. You can continue eating meat the way you've been doing before, it's just not meat that causes enormous amount of emissions. Gustaf A.:                     Similarly for other things in life, I think the best thing that we can do is put a lot of money and smart people from technology and motivate them in the right way. For every great entrepreneur that comes to me and say, like yourself, \"This is my life's work. I am so passionate about this and I can't think of anything more important for the next 20 years to work on than this,\" that makes me a lot more hopeful than for every person that comes to me and say \"I am going to give up flying.\" Because they can have the kind of technology change in society that will change it for everybody, not just people they've convinced. And not only that, those are potentially good companies to start. There's a bunch of things that are positive with that versus just trying to go around the world and convince people to change their lifestyle. I think it's a much harder thing to do and I can't think of a really great example where just down people's lifestyle changes made societal change happen. I think you need systematic change and legal change and a bunch of different things that need to change than just people's opinions or people restraining themselves. Gustaf A.:                     I don't really believe in that. It doesn't mean that that's not sort of a moral signal. I really just don't believe in it. I think that the best chance we have to make this change is to just fund lots and lots of people that are working on things that are going to be decarbonize our society. And I think that in some sense YC is a combination of a bunch of crazy bets. Who knows if they will really work out. And a bunch of more safer bets, which the safer bets are more typical like the SAS, BDB companies. And for every SAS, BDB companies, we can do some crazy bets because they sort of allow us to fund more things. But I think we need to do both, because otherwise if YC would just stay and fund the things we found in the very beginning like consumer internet, we'd have a much smaller YC right now because consumer internet isn't very big right now. And if YC has expanded to hardware and biotech and SAS and BDB and Enterprise, that allowed us to have a bigger impact on the world. Gustaf A.:                     So until funding carbon removal or climate change investments is the biggest market, we're going to have to do many other things to sustain ourselves to be able to do that. So I don't think that it would be right to just go all in on this. And again, it's not just about a funding problem, it's inspiring founders to work on this thing. And I believe you need to be in the mainstream. The kind of founders I want to start these companies are people that haven't worked on these things in the past. Because there just aren't that many people that have done it in the past. We need new people. Gustaf A.:                     So for that reason I believe that it's really important for me to be in the mainstream of technology and for YC to be in the mainstream of technology. There's no conflict here and I don't think it would be a good use of my time to go and be extreme right now. Jason Jacobs:                Well, I thought this was a really fascinating discussion. I definitely learned a lot. And for what it's worth, I'm glad that you guys are here. It's early, but we need more shots on goal, we need more learning, and I like the ambition and I like the focus. So I'm glad that you came on the show and I'm glad that you're doing what you're doing. So please keep it up. Gustaf A.:                     Thank you so much. Thanks for organizing this podcast. There are not that many great podcasts, or not that many at all, around this topic. And I have been listening to all of them. And just to get a sense for what goes on in the world. I have a feeling that a year from now there will so much buzzing in this space that you won't be able to follow everything that's going on. But at this point, I feel like in many cases you're able to follow everything because it still feels pretty small. But I think it's just a thing that we'll both do and then soon there'll be so many people that we'll meet that work on these things that we can't even keep count. Jason Jacobs:                That's my bet as well. And my hope also, both selfishly and for good of the world. Gustaf A.:                     Thank you so much.

Thank you.\nEpisode Transcript\nJason Jacobs:                Hello, everyone. This is Jason Jacobs and welcome to My Climate Journey. This show follows my journey to interview a wide range of guests to better understand and make sense of the formidable problem of climate change and try to figure out how people like you and I can help.\n\nJason Jacobs:                Hello, everyone. Jason here. Today's guest is Gustaf Alstromer, a partner at Y Combinator who's involved with their carbon investing and also the former product lead of growth at Airbnb. In this episode we cover a number of topics, including what Y Combinator is up to with their carbon investing, Gustaf's role, some of the history that lead to them getting involved in this carbon investing, as well as an in depth look at some of the companies that they've backed so far and what they look for in climate focused startups. I left this conversation with a much better idea of how Y Combinator is thinking about these issues. And hopefully it'll be helpful to any aspiring entrepreneurs that are doing work in this area in terms of thinking through whether Y Combinator might be a fit. Without further ado, here's Gustaf. Gustaf, welcome to the show.\n\nGustaf A.:                     Thank you so much, Jason.\n\nJason Jacobs:                Well, I'm glad you're here. We had one meeting out in San Francisco, gosh, probably a few months ago now. But we've been emailing a bunch and you've pointed some deal flow my way and I feel like you're kind of a fellow traveler for me at this point in my climate journey.\n\nGustaf A.:                     Yeah. I feel like I'm on a journey, too. It's been going on for a while, but there's so much new things to learn that I feel like you're constantly learning when you're in this space.\n\nJason Jacobs:                So maybe that's where we should start. I'm super curious, I don't think I asked you this question when we met, either, that your background looks kind of like my background. You grew up in consumer internet and now you're doing climate stuff. So how did that come about for you? How did that come about for YC? How did you guys get here?\n\nGustaf A.:                     Sure. I just want to ... I'm not doing 100% climate or [inaudible 00:02:09]. That's not really what I'm working on at YC. But I am involved with some of the things that we have funded. But it's not something that takes up most of my time. But I've been thinking about it for a long time and I've been actively trying to fund companies that work on these problems. So I will talk about that for sure.\n\nGustaf A.:                     So my background, I came to the US a long time ago. I grew up in Sweden and most recently before Y Combinator, so Y Combinator I've been at for about 2 years as a partner and before that I worked as, initially, a PM and then started the growth team at Airbnb, worked on that team and built it from just a few people to a large team over almost 5 years. The one thing I would say ... and the previous company before that was called Voxer, it was a walkie-talkie app. So both Airbnb and Voxer was consumer companies for sure and I worked on product and growth for both of them.\n\nGustaf A.:                     The one thing I would say-\n\nJason Jacobs:                And they both got big, right?\n\nGustaf A.:                     Both of them got pretty big, although Airbnb is got bigger than Voxer. But the one thing I learned at Airbnb is how valuable the scientific method can be for building product and doing growth. I.E, basically there's a bunch of data and then you can learn something on data and the data tells you what to do next. And we utilized that a lot in the growth team at Airbnb. And a lot of growth and the science of growth, in my opinion, is just math. So you add up a bunch of different choices of traffic and how it converts, and then you do the calculations and you decide what to work on.\n\nGustaf A.:                     I think that climate is very similar. It is very much a problem of math, a systemic problem, but it's something that ... where math plays an important role. Understanding what are the huge sources of emissions, how much does it cost to replace them with something new? So the idea of a carbon tax or price on carbon, all of these things in some sense is quite similar in the sense that you use math to figure out what to do next and what's important. But I would have to say that's one of the things that connects these two things together. Besides that, I don't actually remember what made me curious about climate, but I've always been very curious about new technology. And I was particularly curious about how new to tech could help solve climate change. How everything from carbon removal to de-carbonization technologies like electric cars. All of this stuff has always fascinated me.\n\nGustaf A.:                     So that's, I guess, my background. I have a very pragmatic view on how to solve things and I do believe that industry plays a very, very important role in this. Even though there's a systemic and some political solution to it, but I do think the industry plays a very big, important role.\n\nJason Jacobs:                And you mentioned that this stuff is only one aspect of your role at Y Combinator, so what are you doing at YC?\n\nGustaf A.:                     Yeah. So I joined as a partner about two years ago. Twice a year we fund lots of startups, often the first money in and the first time those companies start working on their startups. And we have a program where we fund all kinds of companies now in every single category and they do our program for three to four months after that. And doing that program, we help them immensely. The most important thing is what should they be doing during those three months is [inaudible 00:05:03] things that you can do as a new start up founder, and we try to focus them as much as we can. And then at the end of the program we help companies with fund raising. So hopefully after those three or four months, the companies have raised funding and continue growing as a startup.So for most of the time at YC, I work with these companies, typically between 30 and 40 companies, for those three or four months, twice a year.\n\nGustaf A.:                     Between that, we have a long interview process and we have a bunch of other things that we do. And one of the things that we did, which was about a year ago or a little less than a year ago, was we put up some requests for start ups. And this has been around for a long time within Y Combinator, where we publish a website, ycombinator.com/rfs, where we just list the problems that we think are important to work on as an inspiration for people to start start ups to work on those problems. And it serves two purposes, one is it actually inspires people to work on those things and two, it tells the world that we're actively trying to fund companies that work on these things. And sometimes when we say we fund everything, sometimes people still think that \"The thing that I'm working on isn't included in everything. So I'd better not apply because they will never accept me anyway.\" So that's the dual purposes of the request for start up document.\n\nGustaf A.:                     And about a year ago, we put carbon removal technologies as one of the topics. And I was surprised how much interest we got from that post. And then a few months later we put something called carbon.ycombinator.com where we published a bunch of ideas of more radical or more out there ideas on how you can remove carbon from the atmosphere. And it just after that we got lots of people to apply with ideas to remove carbon from the atmosphere.\n\nGustaf A.:                     We've been funding de-carbonization technologies for a long time. Everything from electric flights to solar panel companies, to all kinds of things, chemical companies. So we've been doing this for quite a while. But the specific focus on removing carbon from the atmosphere was something that we added about a year ago and that's been very exciting since then.\n\nJason Jacobs:                And looking at all the different areas that could affect climate change and de-carbonization, what made you focus on carbon removal?\n\nGustaf A.:                     Primarily because it was ... not a lot of people were focusing on this. I came to the conclusion that we absolutely need to do, as a society, both de-carbonize and remove carbon from the atmosphere. We have to do both. It's simply not enough to do just one of them. And there are lots of things in the world that we don't have any good ideas on how to de-carbonize. So everything from steal production to concrete to flying across the globe, all kinds of things that are very difficult to de-carbonize. And in addition to that, I think the accuracy reports, nearly all of them, suggest that there's a huge amount of carbon removal that is require. It's often not really specified how it's going to happen. Historically people have just talked about \"Oh, we need to plant some more trees or do what we've done in the past.\" I think there are many different categories of technologies in carbon removal that I find fascinating. But we've funded a couple of companies and I will be more than happy to talk about them in a second. But I think mostly because other people weren't doing it, we knew that it was required, and ... yeah that's probably why we decided to focus on that.\n\nGustaf A.:                     If it turned out that carbon removal technologies had a breakthrough, then that would be very big because it is the one thing that matters to all de-carbonization, is we find a cheaper way of removing carbon from the atmosphere. That wasn't necessarily the goal, but it is a very impactful thing if we can get the cost of removing carbon from our atmosphere down to a low number.\n\nJason Jacobs:                Yeah, if you don't mind, maybe that's a nice lead in to ... it'd be great if you could talk a little bit about the some of the companies you've backed in this area. Just so that me and the listeners can get some context for what types of companies do this carbon removal and what types of companies get you guys excited in this area.\n\nGustaf A.:                     Yeah. So in the last batch that ended just two months ago we had two companies. The first one is called Pachama. Pachama was founded by two founders. One of the founders was a YC alum, Diego, and he had previously started a company making one of the first smart suitcases in the world. After he came back and we started talking to him about starting Pachama, he came to me with the idea this is his life's work. This is the thing he wanted to do for the significant amount time going forward. And he wanted to have real impact. He grew up in Latin America and had seen the deforestation of that part of the world. And he wanted to figure out how you can incentivize farmers to either not cut down the trees or to reforest the land that previously had been deforested. And what was lacking was a clear incentive for those farmers on how to do this. They didn't know exactly why they would do that.\n\nGustaf A.:                     Now in several parts of the world, the European Union, parts of the US, California, and soon China, there are existing carbon markets where you can get paid to either remove or in some cases avoid carbon from being emitted in the atmosphere. And those are things that did not reach those farmers in Latin America. So he wanted to start a new market place for carbon removal. And I think this idea is very ... it's in the center of the whole idea of carbon removal, because if you are a farmer and you have a new idea for a new crop that is extremely efficient at removing carbon from the atmosphere, now somehow you need to get paid. This needs to participate or exist in a market where there's a compliance run by governments or a voluntary market where individuals or companies can participate. Any new idea needs to participate in some market place.\n\nGustaf A.:                     So his idea was to start that market place. It's called Pachama. He's starting with probably one of the biggest, or if not the biggest, opportunity for carbon removal, which is planting trees. So trees have an enormous opportunity to remove carbon, both by not taking trees down and also by reforesting land. Now the challenging part has been how do you measure how much carbon is being stored in those trees and how do you pay out the money and who gets paid for what. So his platform solves all of these things and they use satellite technology and machine learning to try to predict the carbon intensity in a forest. And then as a result of that, they're able to pay out to those farmers as they're storing carbon in their forest. So that voluntary carbon price is somewhere between I believe $8 and $15. And that's how much you can get paid per ton of CO2 that they can prove you are storing in your forest. So they're launching very soon. They've got an enormous amount of interest from buyers.\n\nGustaf A.:                     So what I can tell for sure is that, and this we knew before, is that there is a very big interest for lots of participants in society to actually go carbon neutral. It just hasn't been very easy to do so. And one of the companies that we looked at was Strike. If you go to strike.com/environment, they'll talk in detail how they went carbon neutral. And I know that it's easy. It's not easy to do that in an organization, which it shouldn't be that complicated.\n\nGustaf A.:                     So that's the first company, Pachama. The second company is called Prometheus Fuels. If you are familiar with carbon engineering, this is a very similar outcome where the input is energy and it's CO2 and it's water, and the output is fuel. And fuel in the sense that this is the kind of gasoline, high performance gasoline, that you can run in a car. And he also [inaudible 00:12:02]. He hasn't been as public as Pachama about what he's working on, but it's basically a similar idea. And the whole purpose of Prometheus is that he will produce fuel and in return get public field credit so he can sell it cheaper and eventually sell it at market price. And that's a hard thing to do. If there is even a small chance that that would work, it would be a no brainer investment for an investor because the potential value by creating cheaper fuel than gasoline is ... you can even imagine how they get this. So if there's any chance that something like that might actually succeed, then that's very interesting for us.\n\nGustaf A.:                     So those are the two companies we funded in the last batch and both of them focus on removing carbon from the atmosphere in some way.\n\nJason Jacobs:                Mm-hmm (affirmative). So those companies have a similar mission, but look very different from each other in terms of the actual solution. So do they get put through the same process with the same people as the rest of the Y Combinator companies or is there a different set of expertise and/or a different process required?\n\nGustaf A.:                     So we don't have a specific track for climate change or carbon removal. What we do is we break up the batch in a number of groups. So typically we have four or five groups. And some groups are focused on hardware, some of the focus on bioengineering or bio track, and many of them are just focused on consumer and BDB and SAS. So the most likely outcome if you apply with a more hardware oriented idea is that you get put in a group with a bunch of other companies, or maybe even a subgroup of other chemical companies. [inaudible 00:13:24] market place, you might actually be put in a group with other market place companies, or in Diego's case with other SAS companies because he affectively sells to business. That's where we're like \"That's the customer.\"\n\nGustaf A.:                     There's nothing special about the carbon removal. I think what we wanted to accomplish is we actually wanted to fund founders who are passionate about these ideas, but to make them be exactly like all the other companies. That they would learn all the other things that all the other companies learn. There was no purpose in treating them differently in my opinion. I think we need to treat them the same, and specific we need to make sure that they understand that the commercial expectations of them from the market after us are the same. There will be some optimistic investors, for sure, that are more passionate about this. But if you treating these companies as something else than commercial companies, then I think it will only hurt them in the long run.\n\nJason Jacobs:                Mm-hmm (affirmative). And so how do you evaluate ... and I guess there's factors in terms of the traditional software investing that is more capital efficient and can compress the timelines to scale, and then some of the areas of climate change, at least the ones that I've been looking at, they're more science realist, they're more capital intensive, there's more of a time horizon. So how do you guys think about that when evaluating the right fit for YC from this area?\n\nGustaf A.:                     Well, one of the things we think about is what are the chances that this company would raise money [inaudible 00:14:41]? If you have a two assign ... if you're half way through your research and you have two years ahead of yourself going forward and at the end of the day you will have nothing to show but some science, in general it's harder to get those companies funded. So I think it's pretty important that during YC you spend quite a bit of time trying to think about what are the commercial aspects of what you're doing. Even if you're going to do science for continuous times, then thinking of what the commercial impact of what you're doing I think is really important. And that's sort of true for a category like your biotech companies. You might have a drug on the market for several years, but it's really important that they start thinking in terms of who are the customers, what does the FDA process look like, et cetera.\n\nGustaf A.:                     So I think we think about it in the same way for these companies. I would argue that even if you had a great technology for say, using oceans to remove carbon from the atmosphere, it's unclear today, even if it was ready to go, how you take that to market. It's not clear that there is anything obvious to plug into. And I think it's better that we first build infrastructure where these technologies can plug into where the money is flowing. And I think this is why one of the reasons I'm so excited for this is I think that the world will just come to its senses and start realizing that paying for fixing climate change is going to cost a lot of money. And that money is going to have to flow through a bunch of systems into either de-carbonization or to removing carbon from the atmosphere. And there's going to have a lot of new companies because we knew the companies in the past either don't exist or they're just not very good. And we need to have a software revolution in these companies as well.\n\nGustaf A.:                     So going back to that example of someone coming up with a new idea, storing carbon in the oceans, for example. It needs to plug into a system where there's money flowing into that technology to remove carbon. It needs to be easy to verify, transparent, and all those things. And this is sort of like what carbon removal or carbon offset markets have had a challenge with in the past.\n\nGustaf A.:                     So I believe that there are a lot of opportunities right now to do things that are not super expensive. Even in the case of Prometheus, they're not building big factories like carbon engineering. They're building small machines.\n\nJason Jacobs:                How do you go about diligencing these companies? Given ... it sounds from your stated focus like you're a generalist organization. So does the diligence process in climate resemble the diligence process in any other aspects of YC that you're actively investing in or do you find that a different process is needed there?\n\nGustaf A.:                     No, it's the same. It's the same. The most important diligence is on the founders themselves because so many of the companies that come to YC don't really have something that's working. But besides that, we were asking people to submit a demo, we were asking people to submit videos of the things that they're working on and see if it's working. And to the extent we have to do more scientific diligence, we do that too. And we have some people that are involved that have expertise and background in that. But we're not taking the same level of diligence that let's say a large firm would have, because we just simply don't have the time. We learned so much about these companies during the batch that that in some sense ... if someone was lying about what they were doing when they applied, it would be very clear during the next four months because we will meet with you every week for four months.\n\nGustaf A.:                     But the most important diligence is on the founders themselves and what is their background. Do they seem credible to be able to do something like this? But it's not ... we are a little bit different than other firms in that we fund primarily people, and that's what we do when we fund them. And then in many cases they become companies during the batch, but they weren't necessarily fully figured out companies when they applied to YC.\n\nJason Jacobs:                How do you think about ... maybe this is a different frame than you think, but I think about the insiders that have been working on climate for decades. And then the people like you and I that are the opposite of fair weather fans, we only come in when things get really bad. So how do you think about that when you look at your founding teams in this area? How important is industry, expertise?\n\nGustaf A.:                     A really good question and something I've been spending a lot of time thinking about. Because many of the founders who apply look a little bit different here. They have a different background. And I don't want to be too generalizing here, but I would say that being say someone with experience from Silicon Valley, I think it's actually very helpful here in terms of how quickly can you move into a working prototype, how quickly can you try to figure out the commercial value of what you're building, how lean can you make your operation. Many of the aspects that I would say have been good to entrepreneurships that come out of Silicon Valley, I think that I want to see more of in these companies. It doesn't mean that you have to move extremely fast or skip things in order to get things done, but that's one thing that there was a lack of. And some of the best founders, in my experience, are ... many of the people that work for software startups actually don't have a software background. They might have studied physics or chemical engineering or mechanical engineering in university. But when they came to the job market then it was Facebook, and it was Airbnb and it was Strike and all these companies they ended up working for. But that's actually not what their initial passion was.\n\nGustaf A.:                     So that's a quite common background that I see, is that some already actually have the skill sets from the beginning. They've just been doing other things for a while. So there's one of them.\n\nGustaf A.:                     I think for the more research oriented teams it's the commercial viability and how fast you move, and understanding how you can change your funding structure from mostly grants to commercial investors. I think those are the three things that those kind of teams need the most help with.\n\nGustaf A.:                     I've learned a lot about this and I think what I was going to get to when you asked the question was since we've put out this request for startups, I've had probably a few dozen engineers that email me that work at great companies and ask me \"Where should I go to work? I want to work on climate change.\" I've also had extremely successful founders who have emailed us and said \"I'm staring a company. I want to figure out these things.\" So I would say that forward thinking people that see on the horizon what's going to happen are already starting companies and already thinking about this stuff to a very different degree than even just two years ago.\n\nGustaf A.:                     I'm actually very optimistic and the best thing that we can do as an organization at YC is both have the first companies that we fund be commercially successful in that at least do well in financing to show that this is a path through how you can get your financing so you don't have to go route of taking grants from the government.\n\nJason Jacobs:                How much overlap is there between the financing players for these types of companies versus the other companies in YC, the more traditional software or Silicon Valley types of companies?\n\nGustaf A.:                     You'd be surprised how high the overlap is. So I used to describe Demo Day as people that come to Demo Day are in this combination of ... of course there's a bunch of large firms, but in terms of the individual initial investors that come to Demo Day, they are often successful founders who started software companies in the past and now invested some of their own money. It turns out that that type of people are also very excited about stopping climate change. And they are excited about using technology to do that and they actually see that that's a natural evolution. So those are the same people that fund our software companies that don't focus on this at all.\n\nGustaf A.:                     So I would actually argue that it's exactly the same audience. There are some funds that are specifically focused on this, but they are not the majority of the investors. And if you look on, for example, we've had companies doing electric airplanes that are being funded by the same kind of people that fund other software companies. We've had a number of other companies in green energy, for example, and it's often funded by the same type of investors. I actually think that that's the strength of our Demo Day is that we have a different set of investors where you don't need to go to some various expected five or ten investors in your category and have a very long diligence process, that things can move a bit faster. And I think that's a huge strength of Demo Day and of YC in general. Just like you don't need to the typical type of investors with expertise in that category, you just need any set of investors. Maybe it sounds dangerous, but I don't think that at all.\n\nJason Jacobs:                I think it's pretty new so maybe there's not enough data yet, but how does that look downstream once you get into later stage growth type of rounds?\n\nGustaf A.:                     This is a great question. The short answer is we don't know yet. Similarly, we've funded many, many new areas or categories of the world in technology. Each one of them had to be figured out by research investors. So the thing that's on the news right now is Latin America where suddenly there's lots of money flowing into Latin America. When we started funding Latin American companies, there was nothing. There was almost no local investors and there was no US investors who ever would fly to Latin American founded companies. Africa is the same thing where we've founded now a number of very, very successful companies that are reaching to those B stage, maybe later. And I don't think that US investors are flying to Africa to fund them, so we need to have a new investment ecosystem there. And the best thing that we can do is just to train investors, the late stage investors, where they should be looking and then I would tell them right now \"You should be looking at Latin America, looking at Africa. There are some extremely healthy companies, just based on their numbers doing really well.\"\n\nGustaf A.:                     And I think the same would happen for these kind of companies that as long as they remain focused on the commercial outcome and they're trying to make money while stopping climate change at the same time, the same type of investors that fund the software companies will eventually fund them. Maybe in the hardware case, it might be a little bit different. But for anything that's not entirely hardware, I think it will be very similar.\n\nGustaf A.:                     Equally, I mentioned that I had a bunch of software engineers who talk to us, we've also had enormous amount of press and an enormous amount of investors that just wanted to learn about how to fund the companies in this space. So I've been very optimistic, just by the response from people I did not expect after we put out the request for startups about carbon removal and people that wanted to get into this space in some way. And I realized that YC had some amount of influence, so I'm happy that this is happening.\n\nJason Jacobs:                And when you say investors want to learn how to invest in companies in this space, earlier in this discussion you'd said that that's not different. So is it different and if so how?\n\nGustaf A.:                     Well, for a company like Pachama, I don't think it's different. I think what they're saying is that they're saying that there's a market need, which is people and companies who want to go carbon neutral. And just like there's a market need for a bunch of other things right now in the world, some things that may be known and some things may not be known to investors, there's a market need for this. And I have a little bit of an advantage of coming from the Nordic countries where I see this market need being stronger than in many other places. The Nordic countries and then parts of Europe, and then California is probably where this market need for stopping climate change feels the strongest in the general discussion. And you feel a very different thing when you have to travel to India or travel to Indonesia or travel to other places where this is not a general topic that people are talking about in the same way.\n\nGustaf A.:                     So if the world would go in the direction of parts of California or the Nordic countries, the market need for everything that companies and consumers need to make their part in solving climate change is going to come from, then as an investor you just have to kind of discover this market need and believe in it, and then figure out who are the companies who are best suited to serve it.\n\nGustaf A.:                     For example, let's say you are a company who wants to go carbon neutral. I doesn't have to be a software company. It can be a large retailer of some kind. And there are many of them. Now if that's a market need, how do you do it? Well, you need to account for how much carbon you're emitting and then you have to find an easy, trustworthy, and transparent solution to pay for it, and then go carbon neutral. And then you have to figure out what are the best companies to do that?\n\nGustaf A.:                     I would argue that market need of companies and individuals wanting to go carbon neutral is actually very large and the market is massively untapped, we just need better companies to do it. And I tend to ask people \"What are the five companies you can mention before you've heard of Pachama, that would do this?\" And no one can mention any companies. So people can't even think of what would be a good provider of that service of trying to make your organization go carbon neutral. And that to me suggests, as everything, that there is just not enough good companies working on these things. And as an investor, once you figure that out I don't think the rest is that different. I mean, there is some regulatory thing here that is going to play in and to the extent that companies will ... let's take companies who, as an example, will go carbon neutral because of demands from their boards or from their customers or from the government, I don't really know what will be the driving force. Maybe it'll be different forces in different parts of the world. But certainly there are regulatory driving forces in parts of the world, especially in Europe. And then you just need the most trustworthy and cheapest way to do it.\n\nJason Jacobs:                For the Pachama type of companies, I think that makes sense. Some of the other companies, I don't know if you've funded any in this area, but that were on your request for start ups, the types of solutions they feel almost more geoengineering focused where it's not nearly as similar, at least on the surface, to the more traditional companies that you guys have backed over the years. So in those circumstances, do different rules apply? And I guess as a follow up to that as well, where does regulation fit in and who should be the ultimate arbiter one when these technologies are ready to be commercialized so that for example, we can avoid unintended consequences that could actually be harmful to society?\n\nGustaf A.:                     That's a good question. I don't think that we're trying to ... obviously like with anything you do in the world, there are potentially things that you can't predict. I don't think that we're trying to fund geoengineering. But let's say you are working with five scientists and you're figuring out a fungi that is extremely good at capturing carbon. And there is a safe place where that can survive, and that at the cost compared to other efforts, it would be an extremely efficient way for humanity to remove carbon from the atmosphere. I believe that you would probably fund that if you believe that it's extremely effective. Let's say you're geo modifying a tree that is 10x more efficient at capturing carbon. There's going to have to be somebody that regulates that. I don't expertise for every country in the world which body that would be. But sure, I don't think that ... I'm certain that the founders of Pachama for example did not want to create mono cultures of biodiversity just because they're paying people to remove carbon. So ultimately, I think it's a shared responsibility of governments and these companies.\n\nGustaf A.:                     But I think in some the more out there proposals that we had on carbon.ycombinator.com, the idea was more to inspire a different set of people to work on these things that typically wouldn't even explore it. Because I do think that there are other disciplines, especially chemical engineering and bio engineering, where they can actually make a huge impact into some of these technologies. We just haven't really seen it yet.\n\nGustaf A.:                     So that was initially the idea why we did it. It was that we wanted to inspire a different set of people to come up with these new ideas.\n\nGustaf A.:                     I think it's important to work on just tradition carbon removal for now because if we don't do that and if we don't stop climate change, I think there is a risk that some countries will eventually take on much more riskier solutions when they're countries are under water. So it's very important that we work on the things that we know are safe right now. And planting trees is safe. And maybe of the thing that's these companies are working on is extremely safe. It's unsafe to do what we've been doing for the last few hundred years. But if we don't do them, I think there's a higher risk that people will take to more riskier bets. And that is not something we would fund, but I can see how some desperate people or desperate countries would do that.\n\nJason Jacobs:                Well, one counter argument that I've heard is that there's a difference between funding deployment of these technologies versus funding research. And that by not funding research, it's actually making it harder to regulate appropriately to keep those rogue nations from doing that because the regulatory bodies wouldn't really understand its capabilities or its limitations. How do you think about that? Do you draw that similar distinguishment, if that's a word, from deployment to research? And do you have a different opinion about the research? Or where do you come out?\n\nGustaf A.:                     I don't think we had a great experience with funding research as part of our program. It's just not something ... it typically doesn't go-\n\nJason Jacobs:                But your program aside, I'm more getting at should this research be funded by somebody and are you a proponent of that personally?\n\nGustaf A.:                     Oh, I don't even know if I've thought of that. I mean, I haven't thought about it too deeply. I'm not inherently opposed to it for any specific reason. I haven't thought about that question in particular. But I would say that there is a lack of money in research and the question whether that's going to come from private or government is an interesting one. I would love to see a lot more money coming form the government into these things for sure. And I think we don't really get involved until there is at least some idea of what the market might be.\n\nGustaf A.:                     And I know there's been a lot of interest in YC funding research because we've funded research in the past with a universal income basic study. I don't think in this case that we are the best organization set up to do this. I think we're a great organization set up to take research ideas that are ready to go into market into the market and to investors. I think that's what we do really well. I don't think that we're set up to fund research right now in that space. Yeah, I wish we were. But I don't think we are.\n\nJason Jacobs:                Well, I heard somewhere that you were encouraging people maybe working on nonprofit initiatives in this area. Is that true?\n\nGustaf A.:                     Yes. So we've funded nonprofits for a while. We have a couple learnings from funding nonprofits. The first nonprofit that we funded was Watsi and that was 2013. So it's been about 6 years since we started funding nonprofits. The thing that we have learned nonprofits is to have a really, really big impact on society, relying on donors is not a good way to have that impact. It's possible, it's just not a great way. So it's better, even if you're nonprofit, to rely on revenue where you're charging someone for something. Or at least you're not relying on big money donors, so you have to go out and spend most of the year raising funding or applying to grants. It doesn't scale very well. It works well when you're maybe 2 or 3 people, but when you're a few hundred people it doesn't work well.\n\nGustaf A.:                     The second thing that we've learned is technology can play a huge impact into nonprofits. So not a criteria, but a very common thread among the nonprofits we've funded the last couple years, has been that they use technology to achieve their goals. So an example of that is Tarjimly. Tarjimly is a platform where volunteers can translate for refugees in refugee camps. All they need to have is a phone with Facebook messenger and the same has to happen on the other end, and you can be, within a minute, a volunteer translator for a refugee. That's a technology driven nonprofit. There's no way you can make a profit off refugees. And that's something that works really well that we've been able to fund.\n\nGustaf A.:                     I think there are historical set up nonprofits that we're unlikely to fund because of how they look and the structure and the things that I mentioned. It doesn't mean that are opposed to nonprofits, but I think that in some cases when people apply to nonprofit, we try to question them and be like \"Are you sure that this is best done as a nonprofit if your goal is to achieve change in the world?\" And we try to convince them to do either a for profit or something in between.\n\nJason Jacobs:                What was it? There was a pretty well known political one that you guys took in as part of your class a year or two ago, right? Which one was that?\n\nGustaf A.:                     Well, we funded ACLU and we funded vote.org.\n\nJason Jacobs:                That's the one I was thinking of. Is there a comparable in the climate fight and would that be interesting? If Sunrise Movement came to you guys, would you have a reaction to them? Or Extinction Rebellion or any of these other grass roots?\n\nGustaf A.:                     I think ACLU was the one exception in the top of nonprofits that we've funded. It doesn't actually look like most of the ones that we fund on a regular basis. We funded Good Food Institute in a similar way, where they are focusing on promoting plant based and clean meat in the world. If a climate change or carbon removal nonprofit came to us, and like I mentioned they weren't well trained at running on big donors and they use technology in some way, then absolutely I think we would consider it. I don't think that we do very well for nonprofits that look like a traditional nonprofit, where the entire goal of YC is to raise more donations. I don't think that we help them very much. Unless they have a very strong ambition to change into something else. But sure. I think that we should do that. We're open to.\n\nGustaf A.:                     I would argue that nonprofit is often viewed as the way to have big change in the world without being conflicted about your profit motives. But in many of the cases of the things that we've funded, the profit motive is completely aligned with a long term change you want in the world. I think that there are many companies that we've funded, the clean meat company is in there, that their goal is to make plant based food and clean meat. And they are doing that for profit, which I think Beyond Meat went public the other week, and is a great example of how you can have a really ambitious plan which has potentially a massive effect for our climate, and be a for profit company. Where I think that people are making a mistake if they start thinking that good for the world means more nonprofit. I think that's a huge mistake.\n\nJason Jacobs:                I agree to some extent. I think the ... well, I do agree. But one thing I worry about is that the interest can align with your business model and mission for some time or maybe even for a long time, but it isn't guaranteed that it always will. And I think Facebook's a good example of that, where at some point there's no guarantee that they won't be at odds. And it's actually likely that at some point they will be at odds, and I think that's really where the friction occurs. And I'm not necessarily saying that means that you can't have a huge impact in the private sector, but it's just personally something that I worry about.\n\nGustaf A.:                     I'd rather have Facebook with great regulation than no Facebook and a bunch of nonprofits trying to do the same thing. I just think that in that case it was probably a regulatory failure partly. Again, I want to ... I'll give a very concrete example. So if you're a nonprofit, how are you going to hire engineers? Well, you're limited to the engineers that are interested in working for nonprofits and are not interested in the motive of getting good salary or good equity. So that limits the number of people you can hire, which in term limits the impact you can have in this conversation. So there are many down sides to it and I think people should be aware of those downsides and do a nonprofit if that's the only thing that you can do to impact that type of change. But in many other cases, I think having a for profit is not in the short term at least, in conflict with what you are trying to accomplish.\n\nJason Jacobs:                I have just a couple other quick questions on the YC side and then maybe one personal question. On the YC side, just one question is where government fits in. Let me stop there. Where does government fit into this equation? The ARPA-E’s with grants or ... because I know some of the harder tech types of opportunities, often times the non-dilutive grant capital can be an important mechanism. And so how do you guys think about that?\n\nGustaf A.:                     Yeah. So many of the companies, especially in biotech, for example, have relied on grant money from big national organizations in the carbon space that can amount in something similar. I don't think that we will have a very active government relations, if that makes sense. I think we'll meet with government organizations on a regular basis, but I don't think they will have an active ... usually I don't think that that is the critical point that makes these companies successful.\n\nJason Jacobs:                Is that a stage thing where it will be very important later on, presuming success in these early stages? But that's for the scaling companies and the later stage investors to deal with?\n\nGustaf A.:                     Yeah. I think so. If you look at our experience from Airbnb and the amount of public policy people that we had at Airbnb, there was two or something like when I joined. And there was 300 people at Airbnb when I joined. So it might be a stage thing where these profit teams are something you build up over time. I don't think it's ever a good idea to have critical reliance on government regulations from an early on stage. It's not good. It doesn't mean that selling to governments is a bad business. I actually think that it's a fantastic business that is changing very fast. But you have to be very aware of how government is organized and how slow they are. And they're not necessarily always a great buyer of things. It's not necessarily what I have in mind when I think about government [inaudible 00:38:23] here. I think of more what are the policies and things that need to change, or what are the kind of laws they need to live up to.\n\nGustaf A.:                     In the case of Pachama as an example, to take a very practical one. I'm sure that the thing that matters to them is going to be how do you plug into the large compliance carbon market in the world. That might be very important. Or maybe for both of those companies, or other companies in the future, there might be [inaudible 00:38:46] that fight for more climate rights or a carbon tax or carbon incentives. That might make sense as well for both of them. I don't really know. But in terms of regulatory environment, I think the ... for example, low carbon fuel firms are relatively easy things to figure out. It's not like you need to hire lots of people to figure that out.\n\nGustaf A.:                     So I don't think we have a strong view for these companies in particular, but I would say that ... let me put it this way. From my experience from YC is that the very fastest moving potential customers or partners that you might have are other start ups. Second to that are other companies. And third to that is government. So it's never the fastest moving organization that you want to allow your business on. So it's not something that you would prioritize right away because it involves a huge amount of risk.\n\nGustaf A.:                     So let's say if I was Prometheus Fuels, and I have no idea of this is what they're planning or not, but if I was them and I wanted to try to sell fuel, from the beginning I would do what Impossible Foods do. Which is go to a high end, try to find my customers who are willing to pay a bit more for their fuel if it's carbon neutral, and then go to high end places where I could partner with, maybe Whole Foods or something like that, where you can sell that fuel. Whole Foods is a bad example. Some way of going after the small, niche private market and not trying to go after government right away. Because I think it'll much more difficult. Similar to the Tesla strategy where they went after individuals to sell their first cars, I think is a good way to get started. And if I was Pachama I would go after fast moving start ups with a good conscience and who plan to go carbon neutral, and then maybe bigger companies with the same motive, versus going after and trying to change the government or policies and stuff right away. Because it's going to take a lot longer time, it's a lost more riskier.\n\nJason Jacobs:                And the last YC focused question is more around ... you talked about market base and how the cost would keep coming down as these companies scale. I've heard some people in the industry, actually a number of people, say that for certain types of solutions they're important to the carbon fight, but that until there's a price on the externalities and there's actually a price put on the emissions that some of the other fuels are doing, or at least getting rid of the fossil fuel subsidies, that it won't be a level playing field and the best technology from an emissions standpoint won't win. Do you actively avoid those areas or do you see building into them assuming that at some point that price comes?\n\nGustaf A.:                     Well, I can tell you what I personally believe. I personally believe that the carbon prices are going to go up. So the fees or the taxes around the world are going to go up. And it'll happen country by country or maybe regions by regions, but they will go up. That is my long view of things. Which means that many of these things will ... and there are many governments in the world, so there's many potential markets where this might happen earlier. You look at Tesla in Norway where they have amazing subsidies for electric cars. Electric cars is 50% of the new cars sold. So if you believe it'll happen, albeit slowly, in some markets first, then it's just something that you just take into account that it will happen. And if you look on solar panels that the reason that we have solar panels today that are able to be market competitive with other sources of energy is the combination of the subsidies of Germany and China and what they did for a long period of time in pushing down the cost of the panels being produced. We might need that things for some other technologies. I don't think that investors are going to be excited about investing into something that is on the consumer or buyer level 80% funded by subsidies. I don't think it's the kind of risk that they are willing to take.\n\nGustaf A.:                     I think that rather when we see a scenario, and this the kind of model that I want to see when companies come in and apply to YC, is sort of what are the things that have to turn right for this to be competitive on the market level price? So if you're removing carbon from the atmosphere, how do you make sure that what you're doing actually can beat trees or they can beat solar carbon, or something like that? Because I don't think that you can raise a lot of money ... and we're not the best funder of something that'll cost a billion dollars before you go to market. We're not the kind of organization you should fund that to. You should find another way of funding that. We're not the best one. At least if it's at the end of that, there's a potential of reliance on subsidies.\n\nGustaf A.:                     So yeah, I think we will very quickly start to pay for the higher cost of the carbon that we emit. It's not necessarily a great political strategy in my opinion, but it is a really good market strategy to get industry to do the right thing. And I believe that it will happen. I'm not sure that it will happen in the US right away, but I really believe that it will happen in some market. And many of the companies that I've seen here actually have the Nordic market as some of their first customers. Some of the most progressive say oil companies or energy companies are in Norway.\n\nGustaf A.:                     Oh, yeah. Okay. So it's not just because they're the only countries in the world that care about it. They just happened to be a few years earlier, I think. And it's not crazy that if you make electric airplanes that you sell them to Scandinavia first, because they also seem to care a lot. And gas and fuel are extremely expensive there. So if you have another means of powering your car or your vehicle, then those might be a great market, too.\n\nGustaf A.:                     So yeah, I think it'll happen. I'm not too worried about it. I think you do the best when you don't rely on this, so you have a real ... you have to fight really hard. And I think that we've seen that online again, that people can do a lot more than they think and history is not necessarily a good predictor of how much you are able to achieve in your space.\n\nJason Jacobs:                So my last question, Gustaf, is more of a personal one and it's actually one that I would be interested to ask you with or without the microphone on. But something that I wrestle with is just that this really does feel to me like an existential crisis and it's hard for me to imagine working on anything that isn't related to de carbonization, especially given that I'm fortunate enough to have some flexibility to choose what I work on. And I guess given that this is some percentage of your time but not the full percentage of your time, is that something that you wrestle with? And how much of a pickle do you think we're in? And how do you reconcile those things?\n\nGustaf A.:                     So I'll make an analogy to Sweden. In Sweden there's a huge debate right now whether you should fly at all or you should take the train or the amount of sacrifices you should do in your life to live a carbon free life. I grew up, I've been a vegetarian for 25 years of my life. I recently learned that the percent of vegetarians in society has been steady at 5% for the last hundred years. So for those 25 years I remember there's been many, many, many organizations or for the last hundred, they were fighting for people to become vegetarians. They haven't done so well. They haven't been very successful at convincing others to be vegetarians. Maybe because it's a sacrifice that most people are not willing to do. So I believe that let's say even half of Sweden would make the sacrifice of sacrificing lots in their life to live a less carbon impactful life. I don't think it's something that everybody is willing to do. No matter how much you want that, it's not going to happen.\n\nGustaf A.:                     So what will happen, or what is a better bet in my opinion, is that we come up with a bunch of new technologies that changes the game. If you can grow plant based food or plant based burgers that taste like meat, or grow real meat in a bioreactor, that is the kind of technology change that will make all those people trying to convince people to be vegetarians feel completely obsolete. Because you don't need to do that. You can continue eating meat the way you've been doing before, it's just not meat that causes enormous amount of emissions.\n\nGustaf A.:                     Similarly for other things in life, I think the best thing that we can do is put a lot of money and smart people from technology and motivate them in the right way. For every great entrepreneur that comes to me and say, like yourself, \"This is my life's work. I am so passionate about this and I can't think of anything more important for the next 20 years to work on than this,\" that makes me a lot more hopeful than for every person that comes to me and say \"I am going to give up flying.\" Because they can have the kind of technology change in society that will change it for everybody, not just people they've convinced. And not only that, those are potentially good companies to start. There's a bunch of things that are positive with that versus just trying to go around the world and convince people to change their lifestyle. I think it's a much harder thing to do and I can't think of a really great example where just down people's lifestyle changes made societal change happen. I think you need systematic change and legal change and a bunch of different things that need to change than just people's opinions or people restraining themselves.\n\nGustaf A.:                     I don't really believe in that. It doesn't mean that that's not sort of a moral signal. I really just don't believe in it. I think that the best chance we have to make this change is to just fund lots and lots of people that are working on things that are going to be decarbonize our society. And I think that in some sense YC is a combination of a bunch of crazy bets. Who knows if they will really work out. And a bunch of more safer bets, which the safer bets are more typical like the SAS, BDB companies. And for every SAS, BDB companies, we can do some crazy bets because they sort of allow us to fund more things. But I think we need to do both, because otherwise if YC would just stay and fund the things we found in the very beginning like consumer internet, we'd have a much smaller YC right now because consumer internet isn't very big right now. And if YC has expanded to hardware and biotech and SAS and BDB and Enterprise, that allowed us to have a bigger impact on the world.\n\nGustaf A.:                     So until funding carbon removal or climate change investments is the biggest market, we're going to have to do many other things to sustain ourselves to be able to do that. So I don't think that it would be right to just go all in on this. And again, it's not just about a funding problem, it's inspiring founders to work on this thing. And I believe you need to be in the mainstream. The kind of founders I want to start these companies are people that haven't worked on these things in the past. Because there just aren't that many people that have done it in the past. We need new people.\n\nGustaf A.:                     So for that reason I believe that it's really important for me to be in the mainstream of technology and for YC to be in the mainstream of technology. There's no conflict here and I don't think it would be a good use of my time to go and be extreme right now.\n\nJason Jacobs:                Well, I thought this was a really fascinating discussion. I definitely learned a lot. And for what it's worth, I'm glad that you guys are here. It's early, but we need more shots on goal, we need more learning, and I like the ambition and I like the focus. So I'm glad that you came on the show and I'm glad that you're doing what you're doing. So please keep it up.\n\nGustaf A.:                     Thank you so much. Thanks for organizing this podcast. There are not that many great podcasts, or not that many at all, around this topic. And I have been listening to all of them. And just to get a sense for what goes on in the world. I have a feeling that a year from now there will so much buzzing in this space that you won't be able to follow everything that's going on. But at this point, I feel like in many cases you're able to follow everything because it still feels pretty small. But I think it's just a thing that we'll both do and then soon there'll be so many people that we'll meet that work on these things that we can't even keep count.\n\nJason Jacobs:                That's my bet as well. And my hope also, both selfishly and for good of the world.\n\nGustaf A.:                     Thank you so much.\n\nJason Jacobs:                Hey, everyone. Jason here.

YC has funded some of the biggest names in tech, including Dropbox, Airbnb, and Stripe. It’s a big deal.\nMichael is also a co-founder of Justin.tv, known now as Twitch, and he recently joined the board at Reddit after co-founder Alexis Ohanian stepped down and asked the company to replace him with someone who is Black. That means Michael is uniquely suited to talk about a lot of things that I’m really interested in exploring on Decoder : starting and growing tech businesses, finding opportunities for new ideas, the growing creator economy, and making sure the next generation of business leaders doesn’t look exactly the same as the last one.\nMicheal and I sat down last week and had a really direct, really interesting conversation about all those things. Then a couple days later, two startup founders who had been a part of Y Combinator tweeted that they had been kicked out of the program for criticizing it. One founder, Paul Biggar, said he was kicked out for tweeting about other founders skipping vaccine lines in March, and another, Katia Damer, said she was kicked out for raising issues with the program she thought were misogynistic. “YC has systematically disadvantaged female founders for years,” she wrote.\nThese are big issues, and given that Michael and I had specifically talked about making it easier for diverse founders to succeed, I invited him to come back and talk about them. He declined, and Y Combinator sent along the following statement, which, you will note, does not address the substance of the issues at all.\nWe don’t provide details into why people get removed from the YC community, but both tweet threads are not accurate. They were not removed for the content of their posts but for breaking the terms of the community. One of our most important rules: we don’t share anything from the forum with anyone outside of YC. This is a community built on trust and privacy.\nWe don’t provide details into why people get removed from the YC community, but both tweet threads are not accurate. They were not removed for the content of their posts but for breaking the terms of the community. One of our most important rules: we don’t share anything from the forum with anyone outside of YC. This is a community built on trust and privacy.\nI don’t really know what to make of that statement, especially because one of the things Michael talked about the most passionately in our conversation was demystifying YC by widely and openly sharing information. And the criticisms of YC on display here are not new, so I thought it would be appropriate for Michael to come and explain all of this himself. We followed up and we were told Michael was unavailable to come back this week.\nI do think there’s a lot in this conversation worth thinking about, and I did enjoy speaking with Michael. But I talk to a lot of leaders about making decisions on this show, and I have to say, I don’t understand that decision at all.\nTranscript has been edited for clarity.\nMichael Seibel, you’re a managing director at Y Combinator, which is one of the most famous startup incubators in the world. You are also the co-founder of both Socialcam and Justin.tv, which is the company that became Twitch. Welcome to Decoder .\nThanks for having me.\nHere’s my understanding of what YC does: Y Combinator takes small investments and very small, scrappy startup teams. You put them through a bootcamp, which has gained somewhat mythical and legendary status for how rigorous it is.\nThen you have a pitch session called Demo Day, which also has a somewhat mythical status. And that Demo Day helps people get larger rounds of funding. That seems very simple, but like I said, there’s a lot of myth around it. I know there’s a lot of actual process inside of Y Combinator. Walk people through that entire cycle and kind of demystify it a little bit.\nI’m happy to. I think we want to start with, what were the problems that YC was created to solve? The first problem for any founder raising funding traditionally is that they needed warm introductions, they needed preexisting relationships. The second problem is, they have to know all the best practices around creating a deck.\nA PowerPoint deck.\nPowerPoint deck, exactly.\nIt’s a very small but very big problem.\nExactly. It’s actually extremely scrutinized and, I think, almost silly. It reminds me of, like, a TPS report in Office Space in its stupidity.\nThe third problem is they’re negotiating against an investor first. So the first relationship with the investor is a negotiation and one that’s not transparent. They don’t know if the company before them or after them raised more or less, or got better or worse terms.\nThe fourth problem is, for the longest time, technical people were not being funded. Only business people, only people with MBAs. And the fifth problem was that after funding, the relationship was only with the investor. The founder wasn’t given a community of founders to learn from, to get support from, to grow with.\nYC was essentially created to solve all five of those problems. And so if we go through; one, you don’t have to know us. All you have to do is go to the website and apply.\nTwo, you don’t have to do a deck. Literally all you have to do is fill out an application that’s kind of like a college application or a job application, which most people have done.\nThree, you don’t have to negotiate with us. All of our terms are right on the website, both the general terms and the legal documents. So before you even ask us for money, you know the exact terms we’ll invest at.\nFour, we put you in a cohort of other companies so that you’re not only getting help from us, but you’re getting a community of people who can help you.\nAnd that’s YC. That’s what makes it great. And so it turns out that those problems still exist, even though YC’s 16 years old. And that’s why, you know, 16,000 companies apply to YC every six months.\nY Combinator was started to solve those problems. In some ways, you have helped to solve a lot of them. Those problems will continue to exist; you will continue to try to solve them. But after 16 years, Y Combinator is kind of the center of the universe for startup accelerators. It has gravity. It is very influential, the way that it works, influences how other people do things, how other accelerators are started.\nYou’re not in that disruptor lane anymore.\nI don’t know that we’re not in that disruptor phase. Most successful companies still don’t do accelerators.\nI would argue that most founders today are still starting their process by negotiating with normal investors and confronting those same problems. I would say that there are more investors now, and certainly more investors are tech-friendly and founder-friendly, than they used to be 16 years ago. What’s interesting is that half of YC’s investments now are international. And in those communities, they look like the Valley in 2005 or even worse in terms of founder friendliness.\nListen to Decoder , a show hosted by The Verge ’s Nilay Patel about big ideas — and other problems. Subscribe here !\nI don’t think the disrupting task isn’t done yet. Now, of course, there’s new things that we’re doing too, that we didn’t do in 2005. But I would say that man, if the disrupting task was done, if all founders didn’t have to encounter those five problems I mentioned in the beginning, I’d retire. I’d be like, “Hey, we changed our community for the better.” But to speak to the new challenges, what’s interesting about the group of people who run YC now is that so many of us were YC alums.\nI did YC in 2007, and then again in 2012. And during that period of time, YC was really just focused on the batch. And one of the things that alums always talked about was, “What are the other services YC could provide you after the batch?”\nAfter you graduate and you’ve gotten your investment.\nAfter you’ve raised your seed round. And, we came up with this tag phrase, you know, “YC is with you from cradle to IPO.” But we had to kind of ask ourselves, “Well, what are we doing after the batch?”\nAnd so what’s been great is in the last six years or so, we’ve really stacked more products post-batch for our alumni. We have a program called Series A to B, which is a program for companies after they’ve raised their Series A to help them figure out, how do you encounter the next stages, the next challenges of a company post-Series A? We actually put them in a new batch of YC companies, and a smaller batch, so they had to have new peers who are at their stage. We have a growth program for companies that are way post-product market fit. They’re really focusing on hiring and company scaling, building out an executive team. Once again, put them in a new batch.\nAnd we have the Continuity Fund, which is a growth fund that can actually write $25, $50, $75 million checks in the companies that are further along. We also have a little product that I love, that I desperately wished existed when I was going through YC, which is called Work At a Startup. So we basically built a common application that allows anyone to apply to all YC companies at the same time. So anyone who wants to work at a startup, they can apply on one website. And then all of our companies can sort through the people who are applying, reach out to them. And the really cool part about that product is, for the most part, founders are the ones using it, not recruiters. So if you apply with Work At a Startup and you look interesting, a founder will actually reach out to and engage with you, which I think is a completely unique experience. So we gotta nail the early stage, and then we have to figure out at every stage of our companies, how do we help them succeed?\nThat sounds like a lot of work. How does Y Combinator make money on the back of all that work?\nWe invest, so we’re an investment shop. So for YC, the standard deal that every early-stage company agrees to is, we invest $125,000 for 7 percent of the company. And then Continuity is a growth fund, they invest at whatever market terms founders are interested in. And so we make money as a fund. What’s interesting about YC, though, is just how much of the operation of the fund is funneling back into, “How do we make our program better?”\nThe early program?\nHow do we make the early program better? How do we make the Series A to B program better? How do we make the growth program better? Basically, a lot of what we’re trying to do is figure out how to give our companies more and more advantages as opposed to just how to line our pockets.\nYou said 16,000 companies apply now. That’s a lot more than in the beginning. You have multiple batches per year . How big are the current batches?\nThe current batches range anywhere from between 300 to 400 companies. And you mentioned applications increasing, it’s crazy. In the last 10 years, applications have increased 20 [times]. And YC has around a 2 percent admissions rate. So it’s still pretty hard to get in, but as more and more talented founders have applied, our strict goal has been, “How do we make sure YC can scale to support as many deserving founders and companies, as possible?” So as more apply, we figure out how to make YC bigger and better.\nI ask every executive for their decision-making process. I feel like with you, there’s only one decision-making process people want to know about. How do you decide who gets into a YC batch?\nI think what is so weird about YC is that because we’re funding batches of companies, we have a very different decision-making process than a normal investor. You know, a normal Series A investor might only write two checks a year. The other thing that’s different about YC is a lot of companies change, iterate, pivot after getting into YC. So you can’t get too caught up in the idea. And the third challenge we have is that we’re often among the first investors. So we have founders who are aiming for some moment 10 years from now.\nWe have this saying, we don’t want to be too smart. We don’t want to be too thesis-driven. We don’t really know how the world’s going to be 10 years from now. Founders invent that world. And so the more opinionated we are about their idea or their market, the more we’re being too smart. So what do we look for? That’s a bunch of stuff we don’t really care about.\nThe founder goes from doer to inspirer when the product works\nWhat are the things we care about? First, does the team have the ability to build the product? You know, our original DNA of YC was funding technical founders. And the reason why was because we felt like they had an advantage in building a product in a software world. That’s still core. So almost all of our teams have a technical co-founder and can build the product themselves. They’re not relying on contractors or consultants or anything else.\nNumber two, does the team have a preexisting relationship? It’s extremely stressful to do a startup. And YC is stressful as a program as well. If the team has some preexisting personal or work relationship, the founders have some confidence that that relationship will survive the stress. [If] the founders met two weeks ago — harder.\nThree, can the founders clearly communicate what they’re working on? Now, this is one that, like, I never understood as a founder. I was like, “Judge me on my graphs. If my graphs are going up, give me money.” And I think what I didn’t realize was that the founder’s journey goes from being kind of “doer” to “inspirer” when the product works. And so one of the things you’re trying to figure out is, “Can these folks inspire the 10 employees, the 100 employees, the 1,000 employees who will ultimately be the doers in the company?” And it’s really hard to inspire people if you don’t communicate clearly.\nThe next one that we try to figure out is, what is your connection to the problem? Like, what is going on? Why do you care about this customer, about this problem? And if we go a step deeper, are you going to care about this problem for the next one year or the next five years or the next 10 years? Because the startup journey takes a long time. We’re really trying to figure out, are you in this kind of get-rich-quick category, or is there something deeper tying you to this problem that you’re solving that’s going to keep you motivated over the long time?\nAnd then I think the last thing that we think about a lot is how much have you accomplished in the period of time you’ve been working? I think there’s a set of founders who basically believe that step one in their company is to raise money. And so you’ll see some folks who, “Oh, we’ve been doing our startup for two years. We haven’t built a product yet. We’ve just been pitching the whole time.”\nAs opposed to teams where they’re saying, “Hey, look, we’re technical. We can build. Even if we have to do it nights and weekends [be]cause we’re bootstrapping, we want to get the first version of the product out there. We want to drive, get the first 10 customers.”\nWe want to look at how long you’ve been working in the startup and what you’ve accomplished, and we want to be impressed and a little afraid because we believe that if you can accomplish a lot with a little, then if given more resources, you can do even more. So that’s what we look at. And to be honest, we default positive. Like, if you’re telling us this is a problem, we’ll kind of assume it is.\nIf you’re telling us this is a big market, we’ll kind of assume it is. Like our job isn’t to kind of second-guess your idea, it’s really to figure out, can you execute towards it?\nHow do you square that with how often Y Combinator companies pivot inside the bootcamp? That’s maybe the most common story; you get accepted to YC, it was really hard. You got an idea. You’re a week in. “Oh man, that idea collapsed.” You pivot, and suddenly something else entirely exists. How do you square all of that?\nYou know what’s funny? We aren’t great.\n[To] put it another way. We aspire to hit all of those points that I mentioned. I wouldn’t even give us an A at doing it. Maybe a B, maybe a B minus. And so what’s cool about our model is that it accommodates that. What’s also cool about our model is sometimes those pivots are good. I was co-founder of Justin.tv. We pivoted to Twitch, it worked out.\nSometimes in the process of working on your startup, you learn something. You learn that your core assumptions were wrong, and that’s okay. But let’s be clear, if you can execute, then when you acquire that new information, you can incorporate it and you can do something with it. If you can’t execute, you might not even learn that you’re doing the wrong thing. And when you learn you’re doing the wrong thing, it’s very hard to switch. So we don’t mind when people pivot. Now let’s be clear. Most YC companies don’t pivot. I think there’s this perception, like, you know, 90 percent of companies are pivoting all the time. And I think pivot is being used in extremely aggressive ways nowadays. It’s kind of the cool term.\nVox Media has a whole podcast called Pivot . It’s the hip thing to do.\nThere you go. You know, someone described YC’s model as anti-fragile. We don’t try to be too right. And there’s a very, very small downside if we’re wrong. Which allows us to give founders the benefit of the doubt. And what’s funny is that so many people who are at YC were alums, and I think that we would argue that YC definitely gave us the benefit of the doubt. I mean, Justin.tv started as an online reality TV show where my co-founder, Justin, was wearing a camera on his head and broadcasting his life 24/7.\nThere has been a very long, contentious debate about diversity in tech — in the Valley specifically, but broadly in tech. What you’re describing is a set of questions that, if you read them narrowly, funnel towards one kind of founder. Someone from a technical background who can communicate to another group of founders clearly. Who can devote nights and weekends to getting something built to show that they have started solving their problem, that has a network or a set of relationships with other people devoted to the same problem. You can see how that narrows the funnel.\nHow do you expand the funnel while keeping the barriers that you’ve described high?\nSo, I don’t like describing them as barriers, because it implies that people can’t accomplish them. It’d be a barrier if we only accepted people who were above six foot six tall. I don’t know any way to make yourself taller.\nSo let’s be clear. Can you have experience with the problem you’re solving? Yes. Can you have a relationship with your co-founders before you start the company? Yes. Can you recruit a technical co-founder or learn how to code yourself? Yes. Can you make progress on your product? Yes. So none of these things, I think, are barriers. I think that what I’ve appreciated about this is, people want to know what they have to reach for. Like they know they’re trying to accomplish something that’s almost impossible. Like, it’s just as hard to become an NBA basketball player as a successful startup founder.\nThey know the challenge is hard. And what they want to be given is accurate information about how to accomplish the challenge. They don’t want to be coddled. And so when I think about my approach to how we increase the number of underrepresented founders in the startup world — I can’t speak to the tech world. I’ve never really worked in a big tech company. Different challenges, I’ve been in the startup world — I’ve always thought about it in four chunks.\nRelated\nArlan Hamilton is building a new kind of VC\nOne is information. For the longest time, the information about how to access this world was only distributed vocally. You had to know someone. YC spends a ridiculous amount of time publishing information about the startup world. Everything that I’ve told you so far has been written and recorded in six different places online for free. And I’m doing it here again. Because we don’t believe information should be a barrier to getting access to this world. And to further that, we created a program called Startup School, which is a free online MOOC that hundreds of thousands of startup founders have participated in, that distributes all of the information about how to get started with a startup. So that’s the first one.\nThe second one’s cash. It’s a big deal, the cash. With YC, we not only have to fund companies. But we have to make sure that they raise money on Demo Day.\nThe third one’s advice. Of course, advice on how to run your startup.\nAnd then the fourth, of course, is community. So YC is kind of structured to try to help outsiders become insiders. And, you know, to be honest, a disproportionate number of underrepresented founders are outsiders. And so I think it’s one of the reasons why I was attracted to YC both as a founder, and to work here.\nNow in terms of the challenges, one of our YC partners, Dalton Caldwell, he often refers to this idea that a lot of times people look for silver bullets, one silver bullet. When they should be looking for 12 lead bullets. And I’ve been working on how to increase diversity at YC since I joined. And what I’ve realized is that there are so many things to do. And I wish there was a silver bullet, but I haven’t found one.\nSo in the last six years, YC has funded about 150 Black founders, about over 400 Latinx founders. And close to 600 female founders. And after doing that, I still feel like, one, there’s a ton of work to be done, like an absolute ton of work. And two, every time I think that I’ve figured out a problem, another problem arises.\nGet specific. What are some of these problems? What’s a problem that you’ve solved, that another problem has arisen?\nI’ll be ridiculously specific. Socio-economic. When I talk to people who have the technical skills, who are interested in software, who are interested in startups, socio-economic barriers are really tricky. So at 23, I’m working at Google. And I am part of the safety net of my extended family — when people need money, they come to me. Do I have the same freedom to do a startup as somebody who grew up, went to the same school, has the same level of education, and same interest, but whose parents were doctors and lawyers? No.\nI think that we don’t talk about that. I was talking to a woman who was working at Apple as an engineer, and absolutely murdering it. And she was just like, “I have people who depend on me. And I need to make sure that no matter what, my family doesn’t fall down.” Now I think that, you know, parents are used to that responsibility. Almost everyone’s used to that responsibility for their kids. But disproportionately, it’s underrepresented founders who are used to that responsibility for the generation above them, and for the generations to the side of them. How do we solve those problems? You know, part of the solution is making sure that I can tell them, if you get into YC and you do well, I guarantee you, you will be able to raise money. But wow, that’s still risky.\n“There’s a whole other set of founders who grew up in an upper-middle class...have all the ability and all the skill to build great products. But they don’t even know what to apply that skill to.”\nThere’s a geographic problem, especially pre-COVID. “My family needs me there physically. I’ve got family members with health issues. I’ve got family members who I’m helping out with child care.” And, you know, historically, YC has deeply encouraged people to move to the Bay Area. Well, that creates a barrier. Now that YC’s remote, that becomes a little bit easier. So it’s like, we can do these tweaks to kind of make things a little bit easier. But you know, what I’ve noticed is that like, man, I can’t solve the general socio-economic disparities in America.\nAnd to some extent, I have to help founders overcome those. Where there’s a whole other set of founders who that’s not even their challenge. I think that’s kind of one of the more depressing parts of my job, is that there exists a whole set of founders who have experience with a ton of real-world problems, and have structural socio-economic issues that prevent them from solving them by creating startups. There’s a whole other set of founders who grew up in an upper-middle class, just beautiful setup, almost never experienced any real problems, who have all the ability and all the skill to build great products. But they don’t even know what to apply that skill to.\nI feel like I talk to those folks a lot.\nMe too. It’s frustrating.\nIsn’t the solution just more cash? If you want to remove risk from a choice like that, the simplest way to do it is to just throw more cash at that problem. So you’ve got a longer window of opportunity to take the risk.\nIf you’re great at Apple and you leave for a year, and you can still float your family, you can go back into big tech at the end of that year.\nYou know what’s interesting? So that’s what I thought. I thought, look, if you get a job at Facebook, that’s your safety net. You can always get that job at Facebook. So I was talking to some college kids a couple years ago. You know what they told me? They told me that the recruiter told them, if they didn’t take the offer out of school, they would never get an offer again from Facebook.\nThey were like, “Michael, that’s too risky. I should definitely work at Facebook for a couple years just ...” And I’m like, “Oh my God.” So let’s be clear. It’s not like everyone wants these kids to do startups.\nSo one, that’s very, very hard. Two, Apple’s not going anywhere. I can’t tell a founder that if they raise enough money, their startup will succeed. We know that’s false. And I don’t want to lie to a founder. I gotta tell the founder the truth; most startups fail. Almost all startups fail. So the chances of Apple failing, basically nil.\nThe chances of your startup succeeding, closer to nil. And like, I don’t want to lie. So it doesn’t matter. Like the typical YC company raises enough money on Demo Day to pay the founders for years, if they didn’t hire a bunch of people. And that’s clearly documented. But it’s still like, “I’m going down a path where probably I’m going to fail.” And I think what’s so interesting about this is that there’s a lot of people who are saying, “Why aren’t underrepresented people doing startups more?” And they’re not recognizing that like, for some people, it’s not the logical choice.\nThese are smart people who should make the choices that are better for their lives and their families. You know, when I started this job, I tried to twist people’s arms to do startups. And these are the stories that I heard, “I’m supporting my mom. I have a family member with health problems. And I was like, “Fuck. I shouldn’t be guilt tripping someone into doing a startup.” Like that’s, that’s bullshit. Everyone should have their freedom to choose the right choice for them. I should make sure that they understand this choice. I should make sure that this choice is well-documented and they can access it. I have the responsibility to promote success cases and say, “Hey, if you want to do this, we’re here to help.”\nAt the end of the day, we have to treat people like they’re intelligent people making the best choices possible for their families and for themselves. We gotta do that. That’s basic respect.\n2020 was the heart of the pandemic here in the States. Y Combinator did go fully remote . The whole program was remote.\nAre you going to go back to in-person? Or are you going to keep it fully remote? How’s that going to work for you?\nI was shocked at how well remote worked. And I was shocked at how it forced YC to get better. And I was shocked at how it made YC more accessible to founders around the world. I was nervous. I went through YC in person twice. And I was nervous. “Could we make something that was as good or better during COVID?” was unclear. And, the silver lining of COVID was it forced us to look at some of the sacred cows of how YC worked and ask, “Why?” It forced us to innovate. And that was a great process.\nI think that everyone who runs any kind of organization is being asked some version of this question right now, and the only correct answer is some version of, we want to take what’s best from the in-person program, we want to take what’s best that we’ve learned from the remote program, and use it to make the best product possible, and the most accessible product possible. And that’s not a one-time decision. I think one of the fun things about YC is that between every batch, we survey our founders, and we ask ourselves, “How do we make the damn thing better?”\nThere’s a whole bunch of serendipity that happens from having people in the office. People are wandering around, they can see each other’s screens. They can talk in the hallways. Some idea that you were never going to have happens because of serendipity in the office.\nThen I look on the flip side. I look at our own staff meeting, which is now in Zoom. And the chat in our staff meeting is rockin’. So the meeting has become more participatory. I have no idea how to re-create that in person. I’ve got this thing that I want, which is serendipity in person. And I’ve got this thing that I have now, because of remote work, which is serendipity in virtual spaces.\nHow do you bridge those things together? What’s the thing that you had before that you want to capture? And what’s a thing that you gained from the remote program that you want to keep?\nI’ll give you a perfect example in kind. When we did office hours with founders before COVID, oftentimes they’d have to drive to our office, either in Mountain View or San Francisco. Figure out how to park. Get in through security signing, dah, dah, dah. And inevitably we were running a couple of minutes late, so wait around. Talk for half an hour, and then reverse that whole thing. So to get a half hour of advice, they probably had to invest about two hours. Sometimes longer.\nIn the remote program, half an hour of advice takes half an hour. So YC partners did 50 percent more office hours with companies. But it’s harder to build a personal connection with someone through a screen. Not impossible, but harder. So I think a future YC is going to one, need to put people together enough that they feel like they’re getting that personal connection. But really, really, really needs to preserve the time-saving components of remote, because if every office hour is done in-person, we’re giving a worse product to the founders. So that’s just a single example.\nI’ll give you another example. We had events down in Mountain View. The set of speakers that I can bring to Mountain View is entirely different than the set of speakers that I can bring on Zoom. If you want to hear from a speaker that’s halfway around the world, well, they’re not flying to Mountain View for a two-hour talk.\nIf I want to give you the most diverse set of speakers that can help you the best, I gotta do that on Zoom. But there should be events where you can actually see alumni who are further ahead than you and start building a relationship with them in person. So I have to provide that kind of product too.\nI think the question we’re going to have to answer in YC is, what parts of it work better in person? What parts of it work better online? And let’s be clear, a lot of people think of YC like school. This, like, 24/7 thing. YC programming historically has been one night a week.\nOne night a week for three months. So most of the time, 95 percent of the time, you are in your apartment working on your startup. You’re not hanging out with us. You’re not in some classroom learning. That’s not YC. And so I want to be careful to make sure people understand, like, from an expectations perspective, it’s not like pre-COVID all the founders were at my house 24/7.\nSo I think that we’re going to be able to strike that balance. And what’s cool is that we have all these great feedback mechanisms. I still work with founders directly. I still help run a group. All the group partners still run a group. We’re all going through this experience with the founders in addition to serving them and looking at all the data, etc. So I’m confident we’ll make it work. I’m actually excited to make it work. This job’s boring if it doesn’t change. I think running a school that hasn’t changed in 50 years sounds like the most boring thing in the universe.\nDo you think of it as a school?\nYou know, it’s tricky. I would say that it’s almost how I would want a school to be. I would love a school that was more project-oriented and less classroom-oriented, that was more about working on something that you’re passionate about than working on something that someone told you to work on, but that still gave you a feeling of a community, that still gave you support, that gave you even more support after you graduated from the school than a lot of schools do.\nIn a weird way, we’re trying to take the best from investors and the best from schools and we’re trying to figure out how to make something great. What’s interesting, I was having this conversation with Geoff Ralston, who’s the president of YC, just yesterday where he said, “I think we’re the only fund where people who raise money from us call themselves alumni.” And I like that. I like that there’s a relationship with the community, not just a relationship with us. The more I think about YC in this context, we’re part of the larger YC community, but we’re not the center of it. You know? We’re just another entity within it.\nThere’s alumni. There’s big companies. There’s small companies. There’s people who go off and work at companies. There’s all this other stuff that’s going on. And we’re just trying to support this community. We’re not trying to dominate it.\nThe dynamic of money has just really changed in the pandemic. What you are describing is school. It’s a rigor. You’re probably going to fail. You’re going to get an alumni network of people who are going to be as hard on you as your friends from college. Or you could just chase the dumb money.\nSo here’s the thing, I’m so happy about this stuff. It’s hard for me to look at the speculation that’s going on in crypto, and that’s going on in the stock market or certain parts of the stock market, and say it’s good. It’s hard for me to say that. The silver lining of that activity, though, that is probably positive for the startup community in the long run, is that I think startups were getting too popular. It was starting to attract people who were more interested in the results than in the work. That were more interested in getting rich quick than solving an important problem or giving a shit about their customers.\nAnd there were all these forces that were kind of telling people, “Oh, it’s super easy. Oh, you can get acqui-hired. Oh, you don’t need to write code, you just use no-code tools.” Like, there are all these tools, these things kind of communicating to people who want to get rich quick that startups was the place to do it. Now with GameStop , with the crypto trading, I’m kind of hoping that that’s a brighter light that’s attracting those people.\nWow. That’s like honey-potting people with AMC trades.\nGo there. All you have to do is put some funds on your computer, and you can theoretically make money, maybe.\nIf that sounds appealing to you, I’d rather not work with you. And so go over there. Now, is it good for the economy at large? Like, no. You know, I wish we had a better way of educating the get-rich-quick people that maybe they shouldn’t just be get-rich-quick people. But in the meantime, I’m actually seeing in the startup world, and especially in the international startup community, more mission-driven founders, not less. That’s really appealing to me.\nOne thing I see often with YC companies in particular is they think they can solve societal problems with a pure application of technology. I’ll just give an example. I interviewed Chris Best , who’s the CEO of Substack. Substack’s a YC company.\nAs I reflected on that conversation afterwards, I realized I was talking about very specific journalistic problems, and Chris was talking to me about very specific technical solutions. And we might not have been speaking the same language. I just wonder if that tight focus on “we can use technology and technology solutions to solve a range of huge problems,” whether that kind of leaves out an entire category of founder?\nThe first thing I will say is that in some large part, I think it’s all of our responsibilities to try to solve societal problems. Like, that’s part of being part of our society. That’s part of civic responsibility. And when I look at the entities that do that, it’s government, it’s nonprofits, it’s kind of loosely organized communities, your neighbors, your friends, it’s individuals and it’s business.\nAnd at the end of the day, all of them are trying to address societal problems in one way or the other. Now, some of those problems might seem trite or not significant. The problem of entertainment is often shat on. Like, oh, people want to be entertained. But, hey, people like entertainment. I don’t think people should be insulted for that. Like, it’s a problem, and there’s a lot of businesses that solve it.\nWhen I go back to your question, I think business of course is solving societal problems. Does it always do it well? No. Can it do it with just software alone? No. Like of course problems are multifaceted. But I love founders who want to solve societal problems, because to me the opposite of that founder is the founder that just wants to get rich.\nIf I had to choose between those two, I’d much rather a founder who’s mission-oriented 100 percent. And, like, eventually, anyone who builds a successful product has to become mission-oriented. They have to be consumer-focused. They have to care about their customer, or else in the long run, they’re not going to be building a sustainable business. So sometimes I think that founders get confused into believing that society isn’t their problem, that they’re just in the mode of “get theirs while they can.”\nThey’re kind of shitting on the commons. And I find this more with US founders than international founders. I find US founders really sometimes take the US for granted.\nThere are some international founders who are just like, “I wish I had half of what you have.”\nI love mission-oriented founders. Now, let’s be clear, right, governments can do things with unintended negative consequences. Nonprofits can do that. Communities can do that. Individuals can do that. Businesses can too. All of those entities have to be held to account for what actual impact they’re having. But society has problems, and if you want to build a business to try to solve them and it’s an ethical, fair business, I want to help you.\nYou co-founded Justin.tv and turned it into Twitch , which is at the forefront of a bunch of creator economy stories. Recently, you joined the board of Reddit after Alexis Ohanian stepped down and encouraged the company to diversify. So now you sit on the board of one of the most influential user-generated content companies that exists.\nReddit is like everybody’s homepage all the time. It has a lot of weight in the culture. It has a lot of thorny moderation problems. It has had some weird governance problems in the past. How has your perspective on Reddit changed after you joined the board?\nI’m not a spokesperson for Reddit, so I’d rather answer this question more broadly. This is what I would say. The economy in America has always been very friendly to small businesses, and it’s always been part of our culture. And I think one of the things that we’re witnessing is how small business is changing. And for the longest time, small business meant starting a shop or a barber shop or a restaurant, and getting a loan from a bank.\nAnd it’s obvious that as software takes over the economy, that has to change. And I think what’s interesting is that if you look at that in the creator world, the old-fashioned thing was you have to go through the gatekeepers, the studios, or the agencies and dah, dah, dah, dah. And only a small number of people become really popular and can make money. And I think software’s changing that. I think all of these tech platforms are changing that.\nAnd I think that what you see in the creator economy is creative people trying to figure out, “How do I build a business online?” just like you would see shop owners of the 21st century saying, “How do I build a shop online?” And so the creators might go to a YouTube or a Twitch or TikTok or wherever. The shop owners of the 21st century would go to a Shopify or something like that. And what’s cool about it is it seems that at least in some areas, it seems to be both increasing the size of the pie and increasing the number of people who participate in the pie. And both of those things are very good.\nIf a Reddit community forms, it’s still inextricably tied to Reddit. If you develop a great Twitch channel and you have a career as a Twitch streamer — we have now seen this — you still can’t leave. Your relationship has become tied to the platforms in a way that the shop owner who got a loan from the bank was not forever necessarily beholden to one chain of banks.\nI disagree. I would say that that shop owner was just as tied in. I don’t think any business can survive on its own. It was tied into the advertising it was doing in the yellow pages. It was tied into the bank that was giving you the line of credit. It was tied into all the different institutions in that community. I think this is the same thing.\nI remember when Emmett Shear, the CEO of Twitch, I remember when he came up with the insight for Twitch. And I think everyone thought that the Twitch insight was that people wanted to stream video games or watch video gaming streaming, and that was not the insight at all. The core insight was that video game streamers wanted streaming video games to be their job. They wanted to quit their day job and do this, and Twitch had to figure out how to enable them to do that.\nBefore that insight, we were lost as a company. I mean, we did a bunch of stuff. We got a lot of traffic. We grew, our technology grew. As a product, we didn’t have a user and a user’s motivation in mind. And Emmett and Kevin Lin spent months talking to our video game streamers, and they all kept on saying the same thing, “How do I make money so I can quit my job and do this full-time?” And that’s what Twitch did. It gave those people jobs.\nAnd so it’s weird that you would make the case, “Oh, it’s not giving them a platform that allows them to stream video completely independently of Twitch.” That’s really hard.\nBut what it is doing is allowing them to quit their job that they hate and do their job that they love. That’s pretty good. Now, I would argue that, like, in the entertainment industry, that’s still hard because it’s still kind of this thing where most of the viewers want to look at relatively few streamers. It’s still very, very hard to make that dream available to everyone. But when we started, nobody was making money streaming video games.\nI think we’re at a maturation point in the industry. A lot of those assumptions are being questioned.\nI think that’s fair. I think maybe the question I would say is that, as much as I love Twitch, maybe Twitch isn’t inventing what’s next. As much as I use YouTube, maybe YouTube’s not inventing. Like maybe that’s what the next startup needs to do.\nLike before we started Twitch, you couldn’t put live video online.\nAs you think about why YC startup classes, who you’re funding their businesses, it seems like creator economy-focused businesses are going to run into the restrictions that the platforms place on these products.\nSo last week, we talked to Horacio Gutiérrez from Spotify. I asked, “Why don’t you have a button that just lets me pay an artist on Spotify and your whole problem with musicians goes away?” And he stammered, and he couldn’t really answer. And the answer was, because they would have to pay Apple 30 percent.\nYou’ve got Reddit. It seems like I should just be able to pay my favorite Redditors for the best jokes on Reddit. I’m sure Reddit doesn’t want to pay Apple 30 percent. Do you think that platform tax is a barrier to innovation as you think about the startups that YC is investing in?\nHere’s my entirely unsatisfactory answer. It both enables and is a barrier. In order for these companies to be successful, they had to enable some amount of new activity. They have to build a new part of the economy. Of course they want to own as much of it as possible. And so from an ecosystem question, I feel like the question you’re asking me is, “Should founders be trying to disrupt the big companies of today?” Yes. Disrupt away. Go nuts, because one of two things will happen. Either you’ll win and your users will get more value than they’re getting today, or in the effort of pushing these companies, the companies will have to improve and get better.\nLike Slack forced Microsoft to get better. And either way, users get served a better product. So, I, as a startup investor, can’t be protectionist. Kill everyone. Like, go nuts.\nBut at the same time, Microsoft forced Slack to get eaten .\nI’ve talked about this with a lot of people. I don’t think big companies competing hard is a bad thing.\nI personally believe Slack was in a great position, but it is very, very hard to build another Microsoft. Not because Microsoft’s there, although that’s a factor, but just building a Microsoft is hard, even if there were no Microsofts. And this is a hidden thing that I think people don’t talk about a lot. Not only is it hard from an execution perspective, but think about it from a founder’s perspective. You don’t have to build the next Microsoft in order to make a life-changing amount of money. So, your motivation has to be far beyond serving your customers, because your product’s available, you can serve customers. It has to be far beyond making a life-changing amount of money. There’s gotta be something else intrinsically driving you to make something as big as a Microsoft or as a Google or as an Apple.\nAnd I think we don’t talk about that enough. I don’t think we talk about enough what it takes to make something that big because there are all of these economic successes. Investors and founders can make money at success levels that are way below “you made the next trillion-dollar company”. But hey, if you want to have a massive impact as a founder, that’s where you have to be aiming. And so do I believe that Slack had the potential to be a Microsoft? To be a top player? Yes. We’re using Zoom right now. Do I think Zoom has the potential to be a top player? Yes. It’s gotta get lucky, it’s gotta execute really well, but I think the potential is there for sure.\nBut let’s be clear. All the big players are going to be fighting against them. They’re all going to be fighting back. So they’re going to have to build a better product. But in this day and age, especially with software, I feel like loyalty is going down and down and down. People want to use the product that works the best. Google has had live-streaming for how many years?\nA software founder who’s mission-oriented, who sees a big opportunity, they chase it and chase it and chase it, they build a software product they can scale without them, so they could get sick and take a day off, and the database in AWS is going to keep serving their product to people and they’re still getting paid.\nYou take a streamer on Twitch or a YouTuber or an Instagram influencer or whoever, they’re fundamentally unscalable, so they might be still mission-driven, they might still work just as hard. But if they take a day off, they make less money. But the platforms that enable them will still collect that money.\nLet’s put this up into two different things, right. So, you are a restaurant owner, and yes, if your restaurant is not operating on Sundays, you don’t make money on Sundays, of course, right. The power company who delivers power to your business is always open.\nIt’s always open. Twitch is always open. Reddit is always open. The platforms are always open. So, it’s a different kind of business.\nWe don’t go to the power company and say, “It’s fundamentally unfair that you make money when I’m at work and at home.”\nWe say, “Thanks for the lights,” and “Don’t charge me too much money, and “Hey, if my power’s not working, screw you. I’m going to go somewhere else.” A different kind of business.\nIf creators don’t want to be in the creator economy, don’t be in it. Right? That’s fine. And like if creators want to be in it, but they want it to be better, agitate, complain, build something new, right. I’m not saying you should deny the desire for something better. You should be vocal about it. But I can’t change the fundamental nature of that kind of business.\nI can’t change the fact that your viewers will leave you if you’re not providing them enough content, because in a weird way, if you take a company like Twitch, they’re building a product, a tool for streamers to give something their viewers want. And I can’t control what your viewers want. Emmett [Shear, CEO of Twitch] can’t control what your viewers want. Like, we are all the viewers, and if we want something, we will reward the person who gives it in the content world with more views and allow them to make more money.\nAnd so to me, that’s the economy we’re in. It doesn’t help us to shit on the platform that’s enabling that economy. Critique is great. I love critique. But let’s just acknowledge it’s created jobs that didn’t exist before. It created opportunities that didn’t exist before. There are more entertainers in the world now than there were 25 years ago. There are more people who could pay their rent creating content today than there were 25 years ago, and these platforms are the ones that enabled that. That’s pretty good, right?\nIt is. I just think maybe we’re past the point where you can pay down the new problems with the old credit, you know what I mean? The platforms are really big.\nI would agree with that 100 percent. I would agree that a platform has to earn your loyalty every single year, and if it screws you long enough, it will get disrupted.\nDo you see a wave of applicants to YC that are aiming to disrupt Google Search or YouTube or Instagram? That to me is one of the most confounding mysteries. The end of every YouTuber’s lifecycle is the video they make where they say how mad they are at YouTube, and they have nowhere to go. And I’m mystified at why there’s not a crop of startups aiming to take those creators and that revenue and that audience away.\nYou know what’s interesting? It’s not obvious to me that the thing that disrupts one of these platforms even looks like it. So like we funded OpenSea, right, and they’re enabling these NFTs. And hey, maybe there’s a chance that NFTs are a tool, then, creators can use to monetize. And if that’s the case, then in a weird way, the creator will be less tied to the platform of sending them checks. And so, disruption doesn’t always look absolutely straightforward. And I don’t know what disruption’s going to look like, you know? TikTok doesn’t look like YouTube at all. It is very, very different, and in ways that people would argue are bad. If you were to pitch TikTok to someone when YouTube was dominant and TikTok was started, they’d be like, “So you don’t get to browse what you want? You can’t search for what you want?” People would tell you it was wrong.\nI don’t know what the killers of these platforms will do. And it could be a direct disrupter and it could be something that just renders them slightly less influential every year until they become kind of like MySpace one day. We’ll see.\nOur feeling of apprehension that innovation isn’t happening enough, unfortunately, I think one of the biggest things — especially in the consumer world that that’s tied to — is that the platforms haven’t changed. So like, you and I came up during a time where the internet happened,\nWeb apps happened. Laptops happened. Mobile phones happened. Each of those changes enables a whole set of new companies to compete with the old ones, but since iPhone, have we seen one yet? Most of our young career, we saw these things happening all the time, but at least me, I’m 38, most of my middle career, I haven’t seen one happen.\nAnd if you’re trying to compete with these platforms on their home field, it’s way harder than if VR were to happen, or something else were to happen, and you compete with them in an area where you can be better than them.\nI see the action in the creator economy, and what it feels like to me is a lot of being on someone else’s turf, even if that turf enabled your business to exist. But what I don’t see yet is the classic founder story. Here’s a creator who was frustrated with YouTube and went off and started something that was better than YouTube that solved his problems or her problems better. And that seems very, very hard to me.\nHere’s an analogy that might apply here. I feel like what you’re asking me is why is it hard to go from creating a family restaurant to creating McDonald’s. And I would argue that like in some fundamental way, even though they’re both restaurants, they’re not really the same thing. And so, you actually have to fundamentally change what you want to do in order to build a McDonald’s. And there are sacrifices to that. I think a lot of people who are running family businesses would say, “I will never want to be a McDonald’s franchise owner, let alone inventor of the next McDonald’s.”\nI think that that’s a fundamentally different business. If you want to have the power, influence, and money of a platform creator, then probably you’re going to have to switch from being a content creator to a platform creator.\nIt’s really hard to stay a content creator and have the money, power, and influence of a platform creator. It’s really hard. They’re different businesses with different ceilings. In the gaming world, we saw this a little bit with esports, where people kind of went from being gamers to being organizers of teams and then organizers of tournaments. I think that you see it with influencers, like Mr. Beast, starting food brands . You’re starting to see these people realize that they’re not content creators. They’re entrepreneurs.\nAnd entrepreneurs can create all different kinds of businesses. And so that’s another angle, right. Like as more and more of your money doesn’t come from the platform because you’re the entrepreneur and you use your audience to build other businesses, your allegiance goes away from that platform. And it’s funny because if you look at this in the sports arena, in basketball, right, you can make more money off the shoe deal than you make off of your contract.\nThat leverage counts.\nWhat is next for Y Combinator? What does it look like in the next year?\nNext is going to be figuring out YC in the post-COVID world, which I think is going to be a lot of fun. And I think next is going to be more international. I think investors have pivoted impressively to being able to fund companies over Zoom, which to me means that the startup communities around the world are going to get more and more and more funding, and problems around the world are going to be addressed by more companies. I think it’s going to be great. A hundred years from now, we’re going to look back at this moment and say, “This moment was birthing five, 10, 15, 20 global startup communities.” Which would be great.\nDecoder with Nilay Patel\nA new podcast from The Verge about big ideas and other problems.\nBusiness\nDecoder\nNews\nPodcasts\nTech\nMost Popular\nAnker is recalling over 1.1 million power banks due to fire and burn risks\nMicrosoft just teased its next-gen Xbox console, and nobody noticed\nA massive Google Cloud outage messed up Google Home, Spotify, and other services\nBig Tech quietly sponsors Trump’s military parade party\nHere’s the $2,000 fully AI-generated ad that aired during the NBA Finals\nInstaller\nA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe.\nThis is the title for the native ad"
