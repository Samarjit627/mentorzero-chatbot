This wide-ranging partnership includes:\nDedicated access to a cluster of NVIDIA H100 GPUs and Google’s TPUs: YC startups will have reliable access to hardware for training AI models on Google Cloud, tapping into the same high-performance hardware used by leading AI companies like Anthropic , Cohere , Character AI , Essential AI , and more. Startups will be able to request ad-hoc access through Google Cloud’s dynamic workload scheduler or reserve capacity through dedicated account representatives.\nDedicated access to a cluster of NVIDIA H100 GPUs and Google’s TPUs: YC startups will have reliable access to hardware for training AI models on Google Cloud, tapping into the same high-performance hardware used by leading AI companies like Anthropic , Cohere , Character AI , Essential AI , and more. Startups will be able to request ad-hoc access through Google Cloud’s dynamic workload scheduler or reserve capacity through dedicated account representatives.\nFinancial support: Each startup will receive access to the Google for Startup Cloud Program AI Scale Tier, offering up to $350,000 in Google Cloud credits over two years. Additionally, startups will benefit from $12,000 in Google Cloud Enhanced Support credits for one year, and one year of free Google Workspace Business Plus .\nFinancial support: Each startup will receive access to the Google for Startup Cloud Program AI Scale Tier, offering up to $350,000 in Google Cloud credits over two years.
