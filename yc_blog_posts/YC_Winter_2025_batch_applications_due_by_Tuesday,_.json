    "content": "At YC's Startup School conference this year with Paul Graham and Sam Altman, one of the consistent themes was that this is the best time in the last 20 years to start a company.\nTo better serve founders given the rapid rate of technological change, YC recently switched from two to four batches per year.\nThe Winter 2025 batch will run from January to March, and applications are due on November 12.\nMany of the famous YC companies applied last minute, right before the deadline, with little more than an idea. So if you think you're \"too early\", you're probably not, and you have nothing to lose by applying.\nTo apply, please submit an application by Tuesday, 11/12 @ 8PM PT."
