    "content": "Y Combinator is now running four batches per year: Winter, Spring, Summer and Fall. We completed the first ever fall batch last year and are proud to announce the first ever spring batch.\nYC is doing four batches per year because we realize that with more frequent batches itâ€™s more likely the timing works for founders applying to YC. In addition, the rate of change currently happening as a result of AI is causing more people to create startups, and we want to move fast to fund them.\nApplications for the Spring batch are now open , and the deadline will be on February 11 at 8pm PT . The batch itself will take place in the April to June timeframe, culminating with an in-person demo day.\nApply now to be part of the first-ever Spring batch and part of history."
