    "content": "If you’ve been around YC, you know Michael Seibel has been a huge part of it for over a decade. He’s done it all - YC Founder (w07, w12), Group Partner, and Managing Director/CEO of the YC accelerator. Along the way, he’s helped thousands of founders, shaped how we work with startups, and played a big role in YC’s growth.\nNow, Michael is transitioning to Partner Emeritus. While this means he won’t be involved in the day-to-day at YC or work directly on batches anymore, he’ll continue to support our community in meaningful ways.\nWhat this means for YC: This shift gives Michael more time to focus on other passions while still being a go-to resource for YC founders. He’ll continue sharing his wisdom and experience with the community.\nWhat this means for YC founders and alumni: You’ll still be able to get advice from Michael through office hours and other events.\nMichael’s impact at YC has been massive. He’s been instrumental in shaping our program, our culture, and our values. I know I’ve learned a ton from him - he’s a brilliant mind, a passionate advocate for founders, and a role model for how to go the extra mile to find success.\nThank you, Michael, for everything, and here’s to the next chapter.\n– Garry Tan"
