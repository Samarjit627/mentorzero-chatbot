    "content": "Over the last few batches, visiting partners Jon Xu and Andrew Miklas have become two of the most trusted voices in the YC community. They were both founders in YC’s Summer 2010 batch, and now, 15 years and two industry-shaping companies later, they’re back in a new role: General Partners at YC.\nAs visiting partners, Jon and Andrew have already made a big impact, working closely with hundreds of founders across multiple batches. Now, as full-time General Partners, they’ll play an even bigger role in selecting, advising, and supporting the companies we back.\nThey bring deep technical experience, firsthand startup grit, and a strong track record of helping early-stage companies grow – all of which makes them a perfect fit for YC’s mission to help ambitious founders build enduring companies from the earliest stages.\nJon is the co-founder and former CTO of FutureAdvisor (YC S10), one of the first robo-advisors to make quality investment management accessible to a broader consumer audience. After the company was acquired by BlackRock in 2015, Jon continued to lead product and engineering, building an enterprise-grade robo-advisor platform for large financial institutions. His background gives him unique expertise both in building high-trust consumer products and B2B platforms for regulated industries.\nAndrew co-founded PagerDuty (YC S10, NYSE:PD), which became the backbone of digital operations for thousands of businesses. As founding CTO, he designed the original product and its high-availability architecture, and scaled the engineering team to 70+ people. After PagerDuty, he became an early-stage investor at s28 Capital, supporting companies like Clerk, CaptivateIQ, and Teleport. Andrew brings deep experience in building resilient systems and scaling engineering teams from zero to impact.\nAt YC, we’re always looking for ways to meet the needs of the most ambitious founders. Adding Jon and Andrew to our team strengthens our bench of technical leaders who’ve built durable companies – and who know what it takes to turn early-stage ideas into something world-changing.\nWe’re lucky to have them, and our founders will be even luckier."
